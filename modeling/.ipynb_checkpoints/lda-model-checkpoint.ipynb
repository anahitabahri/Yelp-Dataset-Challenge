       "{0: 'First the only reason this place could possibly win best hoagie is because there\\'s no competition. Two hoagies and a side of onion rings cost $25.74\\n\\nSo I\\'m thinking with the reader choice awards and $10 per 12\" hoagie these will be awesome. \\n\\nI was sadly mistaken. \\n\\nThe only reason I didn\\'t give one star is because is the bread & dressing is fairly decent. \\n\\nSo on to the hoagies, the Italian is general run of the mill. Minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce. You get more meat at subway. Nothing really special & NOT worthy of the $10 price tag. \\n\\nSecond, the steak hoagie, it is atrocious. \\nNo cheese?!?!? You have to add cheese for $1 so now the steak hoagie is $11. That has so little amounts of meat that I thought I was eating a lettuce & onion hoagie. I am thoroughly disappointed with this hoagie, possibly the worst value of a hoagie I\\'ve ever eaten. \\nI\\'m not say eating at subway is any better, but for the huge price difference you are better off doing so. \\nCheck out pasquales down the road, better hoagie & price.',\n",
       " 1: 'Normally, I do not do reviews of an establishment unless the rating is exceptionally great or exceptionally bad.  If I had not felt sucker punched and mugged after I left Mr. Hoagie, I would not be writing this bad review.  On my first and last trip there, I paid $24.59 for two whole hoagies.  \\n\\n1) The Italian (ordered because the woman (she) working there told me it was their most popular hoagie) I ordered with lettuce and onions (no tomato, italian dressing which all come free with the hoagie).  I had to pay $1 to add cheese to the hoagie.  Because I was traveling and would not be eating the hoagie right away, I asked for the italian on the side.  She told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side.  I passed on that on principle.  Are you kidding me?  I just saved her money by declining the tomato.  I was not going to pay for the dressing on the side.  At this point, I am certain something is not right and this place appears to me to be in financial trouble.  That pales in comparison to what happened next.  I opened the hoagie and there were three microscopically thin slices of meat on this hoagie.  Ham, salami, and bologna.  Bologna!?!?!?!?    Who in the hell puts disgusting bologna on an Italian hoagie?  That disqualifies that hoagie as an Italian.  The red flags indicating this place is in financial trouble are blinding my view.  One area of this hoagie only had one slice of bologna, no ham and no salami.\\n\\n2)  The Steak hoagie came with nothing on it but lettuce, tomato, onions, and dressing.  I ordered it without lettuce, tomato, onions, or dressing.  I asked for mayo on the side.  I had to pay for that so I declined.  Are you kidding me?  I just saved them money by passing on the lettuce, tomato, fresh onions, and dressing!  I paid $3 to add saut\\xc3\\xa9ed mushrooms, onions, and cheese.  Here we go again.  Canned mushrooms that were not even cooked through (were still cold) and onions that were still crunchy/undercooked.  News flash:  you need to serve fresh mushrooms that have been saut\\xc3\\xa9ed (canned mushrooms are another sign this place is in financial trouble).  I literally had to open the hoagie to find the steak because I could not taste or see it.  The hoagie was 50% mushrooms, 30%onions, 10% cheese and 10% steak.\\n\\nI could have personally made 10 whole hoagies with substantial quality ingredients and toppings for the $24.59 I paid for these two whole hoagies.  I intentionally patronize non-chain restaurants to support small businesses.  In this case, Never. Again.  (The hoagie bun was better than average.)  Wake up or you are going to lose your business.',\n",
       " 2: 'Cold cheap beer. Good bar food. Good service. \\n\\nLooking for a great Pittsburgh style fish sandwich, this is the place to go. The breading is light, fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries. \\n\\nGood grilled chicken salads or steak.  Soup of day is homemade and lots of specials. Great place for lunch or bar snacks and beer.',\n",
       " 3: \"Never had the hibachi here, just sushi. Decent sushi and selection. A lot of specialty rolls that cater to the Pitt Panthers, Polamalu, Pirate and Steel City rolls. It's a little over priced, but most places in the Waterfront are just  a bit. They do run specials during the week of half off special rolls which is a deal. \\nThe staff is friendly and accommodating. \\nIt's not the best sushi in Pittsburgh, but it does the trick.\\nAlcohol Selections are pretty good with a seasonal on tap. Not sure on happy hour prices.\",\n",
       " 4: \"Best brunch in the area. Interesting selections and who doesn't love a Bloody Mary bar?? The Bloody Mary bar alone had 20 different items to add to your choice of infused vodkas. \\nI had a short rib hash that was bomb! \\nAlso have been for happy hour for drinks and appetizers. Didn't know what to think of the bone marrow when we ordered it...I am a convert. Hard to convince my friends to try it, but OMG. It tasted like Sunday after church dinner. True comfort with a sophisticated flair. The Sgts Pepper Old Fashioned was perfect. Tasted the PBR Pimm's cup....get a driver because they go down easily.\",\n",
       " 5: \"Too. Much. Meat. \\nI'm a meat person. I'll pick that over pasta any day, but this is waaaaaay too much. I guess you know that going into it. Very salty! Overpriced for what you can honestly consume. I was not well for days. A friend just did the salad bar option and even that with a drink was a crazy bill. \\nService was good so I guess that's a plus.\",\n",
       " 6: 'This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak\\'s \"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\" and he\\'s usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I\\'m pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.',\n",
       " 7: \"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\\n\\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\\n\\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\\n\\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \\n\\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\\n\\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\\n\\nOh...but good food counts too. \\n\\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\\n\\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\\n\\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \\n\\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\\n\\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\\n\\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\\n\\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.\",\n",
       " 8: 'I have to preface this review with two factors. One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.\\n\\nSecond, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro\\'s, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro\\'s.\\n\\nMy best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90\\'s in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don\\'t drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.\\n\\nShe and I had met once at Tessaro\\'s.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can\\'t say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.\\n\\nMonths later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.\\n\\nMy best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  \\n\\nI made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.\\n\\nFinally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She\\'d been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.\\n\\nThe next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro\\'s.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:\\n\\n\"LOOK!  We don\\'t have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don\\'t get seated until your whole party is here!\"\\n\\nAnd THIS is what really sealed it:\\n\\nThe woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend\\'s direction, who had only been to Tessaro\\'s ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:\\n\\n\"And SHE oughta KNOW that!\"\\n\\nShe oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she \\'know that\\'? The only other time she\\'d been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.\\n\\nAdditionally, the \\'rule\\' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn\\'t see the \\'rule\\'...a blind woman certainly wasn\\'t going to \\'see\\' it!\\n\\nFinally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager \\'allowed\\' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.  We ate our meal, paid our bill, and we left.\\n\\nAnd we will NOT return.\\n\\nYou can treat me badly, and if there\\'s something I really love about your business, I might come back.  But do NOT badmouth a blind woman, or anyone else for that matter, who is disabled, and in need of a slight amount of extra consideration.\\n\\nTessaro\\'s, you might make good burgers, and you\\'ll continue making a fortune off them.  And I\\'m sure you really don\\'t give a crap about how your manager treated this lady.  But we will NOT drop one dime more in your restaurant.  We\\'ll take our business to Burgatory.',\n",

It's in Blawnox, and it's called Bob's GARAGE...\\n\\nBob's isn't the penthouse lounge at the Carlton...it's a neighborhood bar. And as a neighborhood bar goes...with the karaoke...it was actually a very pleasant little joint to hang out in for an evening with friends and sing our guts out.\\n\\nYES...they still allow smoking...YES, people drink well drinks there...and yes, the food has gluten in it and probably comes out of a freezer bag.\\n\\nGordon Ramsey didn't rescue the joint, and the decorating most likely involves sales at Party City and a hot glue gun.\\n\\nBob's Garage does not pretend to be anything that it isn't. Wanna pretend? Go hang at a Big Burrito joint, or dial up Kevin Sousa. Bob's is a funky and cool little joint to hang out in with a group of pretty decent people, all ages, who are out for an evening of a few drinks (I saw no drunks) being served by a bartender who was very friendly and helpful, in a location that does kind of look like Pool City exploded during Christmas time and landed in the middle of Party City during high season. It's comfortable, laid back, and the karaoke guy on Thursdays, John, was very kind and friendly, and did his karaoke like a pro. He also had a very nice singing voice himself. He didn't rip apart his karaoke singers like another 'Oke' leader in the burgh, who mostly caters to the gay bars.\\n\\nThe other revelers that night were in a range from very good to ouch, but the atmosphere is such that if you can't carry a tune in a bucket...sooooooo what. People clap, and allow you to have a good time.\\n\\nI can't say I'd ever look at this place from the outside and say 'HEY - let's try it for lunch!' Or dinner for that matter. \\n\\nBut for a fun evening just hanging with friends in an unpretentious atmosphere, and jumping up to sing...bring it on. The drinks aren't terribly overpriced, and no one is looking down on your for what you're wearing, or how badly you sound on a microphone. The more, the merrier.\\n\\nMy only suggestion would be for the karaoke guys to bring back the 'books'. I know that everyone is staring into their palms on their smart phones these days, but really...not EVERYONE. And we had a very hard time scanning a songbook online when the signals were weak and the batteries were draining on the cell phones.\\n\\nAnd to be honest - for the smoke whiners - maybe they've upped the ventilation since the last reviews were written, but even though I smoke, I generally hate smoking indoors. And I didn't walk out with the usual smoking bar sensation of having a nicotine trail follow me home.\\n\\nBottom line, if you're regular ol' folk, and would like a comfy location to have some fun with other regular ol' folk...park it in the Garage. Bob's Garage.\\n\\nADDENDUM: Went back for a second dose on a Friday night, and had just as great a time. The difference was that we tried the food. I had a Reuben and my friends had a fish sandwich and the other a steak. Reasonable prices, not uppity gourmet, and not horrible. Just plain ol' decent bar food.\",\n",
       " 10: \"For years...and I mean YEARS, I've heard of it, avoided it, and never had the least curiosity about it. It seemed like a waste of a ginormous building, and hype, hype, hype.  Plus, not being a beer drinker at ALL, the 'Brew' part certainly wasn't going to draw me in. But this past week, someone that I've been playing dueling restaurants with took me to Church Brew Works to see what it was all about.\\n\\nWell, I guess it's pretty cool, if you're a tourist, a beer drinker, or don't mind busting a bank account on one meal.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is kind of cool in a kitschy way. Take a building once used to drain the soul, and turn it over to something that FEEDS the soul (or at least the liver). Not only is the enormous brew machinery on the altar a very cool replacement for bleeding martyrs, but it finally gives da burgh the centerpiece of worship that is befitting them. In addition to the apse-de-brew, all of the seating has been created from the old pews. Even the menus reflect old church programs.\\n\\nSpeaking of atmosphere and menus...I don't eat atmosphere, as I've pointed out in many other reviews. I ultimately go to an eatery to EAT. So after five minutes of taking in the 'atmosphere', I delved into the menu to make a selection.\\n\\nI wasn't terribly impressed with the offerings, and I definitely was not impressed with the prices. If I end up planning my meal according to the menu prices, I've gone to the wrong place. And that is pretty much exactly what happened. We both chose a steak with cheesy potatoes and a corn salad, that was in the $15 range. My friend chose the 'beer sampler', which was like ten small glasses of beer that were supposed to be drunk in a specific order.  So our order was placed, and now on to sucking in more 'atmosphere'.\\n\\nAnd I DO have to say that whoever places the orders for the wait studs in this place has impeccable taste in dark featured hunky real looking men. I was ready to take communion at any moment, or study up on what it means to be an altar boy.\\n\\nOk, atmosphere over, on to the food. The steak was cooked the way I liked it, and was very tender and flavorful. The cheesy potatoes, which I firmly believe are the leftovers from stuffing home made pierogis, was very pleasant and tasty as well. The corn salad, I could have used a few more words on the menu, or a heads up as to what all was in it, as onions are not my friend. I also think they could use a little better aim when putting it on the plate, or not use it as a sauce to top everything else on the plate, which seems to be what the aim was. I really didn't need the corn salad on the steak, or even dribbling over the potatoes. \\n\\nOn the whole, except for the potential acid reflux from the surprise onions, the meal was satisfying and pretty good. \\n\\nThen came the dessert menu, and my friend opted for coconut cheesecake, and I had the tiramisu.  The tiramisu itself was great. My suggestion would be to drop the kind of fakey tasting chocolate poo blobs decorating the plate. They did nothing to enhance the flavor of the tiramisu, which would have been absolutely perfect by itself.\\n\\nOur waitress was very friendly and helpful, the meal was good, and my friend liked most of his beer (with ten of them, it's naturally going to be hit or miss). The atmosphere was pleasant and not TOO over the top 'sports bar' video screenage, and the eye candy just kept walking back and forth.\\n\\nBut once again, I am drawn back to the high pricing, which is what will prevent me from becoming a regular. I'm not even a fan of being treated when the prices are that high. And as I said...if I'm choosing my meal by price more than by desire...I'm in a FTLT situation.\\n\\nI can see how the place would appeal to a tourist, or to a black and gold anniversary dinner.  But as a regular haunt...not so much.\",\n",
       " 11: \"If you're looking for good, old-fashioned Italian 'food' served in heaping mounds for a reasonable price - Big Jim's should be THE place to go.\\n\\nI first learned of Big Jim's many, many years ago, when a friend introduced me to this hidden gem.  Some changes have been made since that era, but nothing for the worse.  They used to be a very closed-in smoking establishment, but the new laws have stopped that, and the result is that you can eat without watching the nicotine drip from the walls.  I'm a smoker, but the atmosphere used to be even too thick for me to fully enjoy.  But even then, the food made it worth the trip.\\n\\nBig Jim's is a divey bar/restaurant tucked into a hidden corner of Greenfield that they call 'the run'. It is by far, nothing fancy. Wood paneled walls, framed tacky prints bearing scenes of Italy occasionally, or scenes of the burgh. Truly, nothing to look at.\\n\\nTVs dot the rooms, usually playing local news, or of course, da game - whichever one happens to be playing. \\n\\nThe service can be hit or miss - we're not talking high end customer service here. You may get an attitude from someone who looks like a mobile home park escapee, or you might get just efficient cordial service from someone who looks like a college student that Starbuck's wouldn't hire.  But really, that's not even important in this setting.\\n\\nThe gold mine that Big Jim's offers is very good food in jumbo portions, and at a truly reasonable price.  I've taken several out of towners to Big Jim's and rarely have they not gone home with leftovers in a take out box.\\n\\nThe pasta dishes are tasty and large, and most meals come with a side salad, or other side of your choice. Order something like lasagna or chicken or eggplant parmigiana, and you're either a Hoover in disguise, or you're taking some home.\\n\\nThe last time I visited, I saw a VERY large man in a Pitt sports outfit at the next table order a calzone.  It took a while to arrive, but when it did, the man's eyes nearly bugged out.  And he was a BIG football player type. The calzone truly looked like a large pizza folded in half. This ginormous sports machine - took half home. \\n\\nThe appetizers are good. I recommend the fried zucchini planks, but everything I've had has been plentiful and tasty. I've eaten the lasagna (took half home) chicken parmigiana (took half home), eggplant parmigiana (took half home), the linguini with white clam sauce (ok, ate all of that), hot sandwiches, and more, and I've never been unfulfilled or disappointed.  They have gnocchi in a red sauce (I swear they used to have it in a creamy cheese sauce, but that seems to have disappeared from the menu - shame too, it was yum), and even have things for the non-Italian people, like cheesesteak sandwiches, open faced roast beef and  fries smothered with gravy.\\n\\nOnce again I say - I am NOT a 'foodie'.  I like FOOD.  And Big Jim's is a place that can fill you up and not rip you off.\\n\\nTwo enormous entrees usually coming with a side, a soda, an appetizer or two, and a meal for the next day's lunch - the bill usually comes to just under $30.\\n\\nIt's a hidden gem - so get out your mapquest or GPS - and find it!\",\n",
       " 12: 'Once upon a time...before profiteering became more important than product, there were a lot of good food items to be had.   Anyone remember when Twinkies or Ho Ho\\'s actually tasted like food, and not like chemical compounds?\\n\\nWell, the same applies to Primanti Brothers.\\n\\nOnce upon a time, there was a little sandwich shop in Pittsburgh that was trying very hard to be like the famous steak sandwich shops in Philly.  After all, Pittsburgh really wasn\\'t (and still isn\\'t) \\'known\\' for anything other than dirty steel mills, followed closely by closed steel mills, and the mill workers who sat around waiting for them to reopen, even after they\\'d been torn down and the property turned into malls.\\n\\nPrimanti Brother at one time was a decent sandwich shop with a quirky gimmick.  They put your sides ON the sandwich.  Yes, you could get a steak sandwich piled high with your favorites...french fries and cole slaw...in addition to the usual lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and cheese.\\n\\nAs time rolled by, the restaurants sprang up in several locations around the city, primarily anywhere that there might be a mall nearby, or a bunch of drunks who really didn\\'t care WHAT they were eating, and there even sprang up one of the shops in Ft. Lauderdale.\\n\\nAs the business grew, the Primanti Brothers started cutting corners to maximize profits.  The meat became nothing more than Steak-Ums, and they started adding everything under the sun that could be served on a bun to their menu to try to draw in more people.  A nice healthy chicken breast...grilled in the same grease as everything else and topped with fries and cole slaw. \\n\\nNow, anyone not from Pittsburgh should know...native Pittsburghers are not exactly known for having distinguished tastes...in anything.  In fact, people in Pittsburgh will stand and give a raving standing ovation and scream \\'faaaaabulous\\'...for what most folks around the country in more metropolitan cities would say \\'eh\\'.\\n\\nLast year, I had jury duty.  The Pittsburgh Courthouse is located near one of the many Primanti grease pits.  I thought I\\'d try a fish sandwich since I was on a limited budget for the day, and time was too short to sit down in any other restaurant.\\n\\nGreasy, didn\\'t taste much like fish, the batter was soggy from the grease, the cheese clearly came in little squares from a plastic package, and even the tartar sauce couldn\\'t make it more palatable.  My stomach felt rock laden the rest of the day.\\n\\nMore recently, a couple from San Francisco came into the store where I work, which is near one of the Primanti restaurants.  They\\'d heard all the hype, and had lunch.\\n\\nThe woman said to me: \"WHAT is up with Primanti?  Everyone kept telling us we had to have a Primanti while we were in Pittsburgh!\"\\n\\nShe looked at me, rolled her eyes, stuck out her tongue and said:  \"Bleeech!\"\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders and told her I agreed.\\n\\nI guess we could say that Primanti is kind of the White Castle of Pittsburgh, only with more \"GOOOO Steelers\" - ambience.\\n\\nIt is best eaten after a drunken bender, when you aren\\'t really hungry, but are the type to eat like you\\'re at a trough after guzzling half a keg of beer.\\n\\nOr...you think McD\\'s is fine dining.\\n\\nDon\\'t buy the hype.  The gimmick of the fries and slaw on the sandwich doesn\\'t make it a decent meal.  Just means you\\'re gullible to local yokel advertising.  And sadly, there really isn\\'t another thing in Pittsburgh that stands out.',\n",
       " 13: \"Truth be told, the options for Mexican food within the city of Pittsburgh are beyond what one would call limited. Aside from the chains like Qdoba, there really are only two that I can think of to choose from - Las Velas and Mexico City.\\n\\nAs far as I'm concerned, they're both worth the time and tastebuds. Las Velas is more glitzy fancy, and Mexico City is more basic nitty gritty. One is location, location, location, with higher prices, and slightly better food, and one is off the beaten trendy path, with only slightly lower prices, and a much smaller menu. Although the much smaller menu seems to have developed some time in the last year.\\n\\nMexico City is a decent restaurant for standard Mexican fare, and although I do have to say that it seems to be on the downslide in patronage and atmosphere, the food is still the same good quality.\\n\\nWhen I went the first time a couple of years ago, the atmosphere was brighter, there were a few more occupied tables, the music was existent but not overbearing, there was a lot of staff running around keeping things going, and they were engaging.\\n\\nThis time around, the back half of the restaurant seemed to not even have the lights on, except for a few people at the bar we were the only other diners in the place, and there seemed to be one waitress, two guys going in and out of the kitchen, and one child of one of the staff, there was almost no noise except for the yinzer trailer park gal cackling at the bar, and the silenced television seemed stuck on the doom-and-gloom Hispanic news channel, which kind of looked like a long episode of 'Cops' on steroids.\\n\\nIt was 5:30 pm on a Friday, and there were no customers. \\n\\nWhich really was a shame, because the food was just as good as it had been, albeit sans a little of the extra 'glitz' that used to be attached.\\n\\nI ordered the Guacamole and chips to start us off. The menu had been pared down to a two-sided one-page deal, whereas it used to be several pages with more descriptions, but the Guacamole description even said 'prepared tableside'.  It wasn't prepared tableside, as it had been in the past, but it was still good when brought to the table. The chips were just right, light and crispy, without a heavy stale oily nature, and Guac, although it did seem a little skimpy on the ingredients, was still tasty, although a bit steep at $9 for a serving for 'four' which really only barely fed two.\\n\\nMy friend ordered enchiladas, and I ordered the 'Super Burrito' which is a large burrito stuffed with steak, rice and beans, cut in two, with two different sauces. The steak was very flavorful and tender, the burrito was very well stuffed, and they hadn't cut any corners on the sauces - they were still as good as they'd been under a more light atmosphere.\\n\\nThe bill, including tip, for the appetizer, two entrees and two sodas (Coke people, thank goodness!) was under $40, and we were full, and our tongues were not disappointed.\\n\\nIt always seems so sad to me to see downtown restaurants plain empty after work, and though I know the trend spots like Market Square will be filled, it makes me nuts that people here won't walk a block or two in a different direction to try something other than the trendy spots. Generally speaking from my experiences, the 'trendy' spots in da burgh usually end up being overpriced toy food.\\n\\nI'm not sure what I can say to boost the business of Mexico City. The atmosphere was very sad...but why liven it up for one table? Another couple did come in toward the end of our meal, but at 5:30 on a Friday, there should have been a hell of a lot more people there. The food is good...and that's what I go out to 'eat'. I don't chow down on atmosphere.\\n\\nBut hey - we had a good meal - in peace. No other pesky customers to annoy us. I just hope they're still there in a year.\",\n",
       " 14: \"A friend and I were headed for the disaster at the Cabaret On The Square, and stopped for dinner at Las Velas before the show.  We had a few hours to kill and decided on trying some new Mexican place.  \\n\\nMaybe it was great company, but Las Velas did not disappoint.  Hugo, the over-gelled but otherwise very nice and kind of hot waiter (seriously...in da burgh, what DOES it mean when a waiter keeps winking at you? I think it simply means tip hard) was very nice and helpful.\\n\\nWe ordered the poblano dip, an iced tea (since Pepsi products are served) and my friend had a water.  Then for the main course, I ordered the steak burrito, and my friend the quesadillas.\\n\\nIt was slightly pricey for Mexican food, but what else would we expect for Market Square?\\n\\nThe Poblano dip was a little runny, but VERY tasty.  The chips were a little over-puffed, which made them frail in the dip, but they were adequate and tasty.\\n\\nThe steak burrito was large and stuffed, and not only was the steak tasty, but the sauces were 'real' and very flavorful. The sauce wasn't the standard 'red' sauce, but it was real veggie and spice enhanced.   It had zing and flavor.  I LIKE hot.  And no, to me, the standard Pittsburgh version of 'hot' doesn't cut it. A Jalapeno to me is NOT hot.  An Habanero IS. And when they asked if I wanted hot or mild, and I asked for hot, it came hot.\\n\\nThe burrito came with guacamole, sour cream, and some pico de gallo, which added to the flavor.\\n\\nMy friend devoured her quesadilla, which came with rice and refried beans, so fast that I thought I'd blinked and missed something.\\n\\nThe bill, with an appetizer, two entrees and one beverage, was around $40.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere was very pleasant...heck, we even had one hell of a show as the Occupy Pittsburgh crowd of 20 made their way through Market Square...with six police cars blocking traffic and four local 'media' vans setting up for the five minute span of activity that took place, including one local 'creative' type who wore a pup tent and danced around mindlessly.\\n\\nAll in all, Las Velas was a very nice place to go for a flavorful Mexican meal, with decent service, and the added bonus of a hot Latino waiter winking, who was delightful to watch 'walk away'.\\n\\nFor the budget minded, I might recommend Mexico City a few blocks away, but Las Velas is a little better in the atmosphere department, slightly higher in the flavor department, with only a slight hike in the price department. \\n\\nGive them a try.\",\n",
       " 15: \"As fast food goes, I generally avoid it like the plague that it has become, but when our company received an envelope full of two-for-one coupons, with my limited choices for decent and affordable lunches downtown on days that I'd not prepped something at home, Qdoba won me for at least a try, and they became like my fifth in line for something to eat downtown.\\n\\nThese coupons were only good for this one specific location downtown, so this location got us.\\n\\nI have to say, I wasn't disappointed, and over the course of the next two months, we went through quite a few of these coupons. Almost every time we went in, the place was really busy, but they've divided it into two lines. One for burritos only, and the other for the rest, and it seems to work out rather well for keeping a smooth and timely flow. \\n\\nThe food itself is pretty good. I mean it IS fast food, so the crew from The Chew won't be standing in line to assess its gourmet goodness, but considering the crap that most conveyor belt fast fooderies crank out, Qdoba actually puts out a decent edible and I dare say even tasty product. I've gotten steak burritos and nachos, and neither have disappointed. They are decent sized, filling, and come with that thing that eludes a lot of fast food factories...flavor. It's not what I'd call cheap, nor is it expensive. For what you get, it's about right. The steak doesn't taste like freeze dried dog food, and the additives like guacamole and cheese are fresh. \\n\\nAdditionally, the staff at this particular location isn't the usual paper-hatted line-up of minimum wage zombies. Some of them are actually kind of adorable, including the little guy who usually starts you off in the burrito line. A slightly cherubic guy, he's friendly, being the starter of the burrito, with the tortilla, meat and rice/beans, seems to genuinely like his customers, and then he passes you on to the next staff member who will stuff the remainder of goodies into your burrito, and usually, they're just as friendly. \\n\\nAll in all, this is a nice option for a downtown quick lunch. Decent food, ok prices, pleasant staff, and a quick in-and-out. A chain worth linking with.\",\n",
       " 16: \"As a specialty market, this really is as good as it gets, especially in da burgh. I had been to Salem's in Oakland once seeking a specific item, and the staff there was incredibly helpful, and when they didn't have what I was looking for, they made a few good suggestions on where to find it. The check out guy was not only warm and friendly, but rather dreamy to look at as well.\\n\\nAnd then WAY back when they first opened, I went to the Strip version long before they opened the market side, and was not only drooling over the impressive line up of home made goods in the cafe line, but was also very impressed with the genuine friendliness of the staff - this was true friendly, not 'hi, welcome to Starbucks, here's your coffee, buh bye' friendly.  I ordered a few things for a quick lunch, and it was all incredibly fresh and flavorful, and the big burly guy with the shaved head and the sweet brown eyes talked to us like we were his new best friends. \\n\\nI'd not been there since the market side opened, and finally made it there today, and was truly even more impressive than I'd imagined. \\n\\nThe cafeteria section grew, and it a true buffet of GOOD Middle-Eastern delights, both hot and cold, vegetarian and meat, meat, meat.  I picked up one of their rotisserie chickens, a container of hummous (some pita bread was free to go with it), and I was considering trying one of their own marinated and grilled steaks. I really just wanted to take a couple of raw steaks home to have on hand, but the butcher counter line was pretty long. So I started to order just a couple of the steaks raw, and they asked if I just wanted steaks from the meat counter in the market, and I said that I just didn't want to wait in line. So the cafeteria guy told me he'd get me a couple of steaks from the market counter, and he did. No huff, no attitude...true helpfulness. My friend ordered a chicken dish with a rice dish 'side', and a hummous, and the chicken and rice dish was enormous.\\n\\nNow, if I'd had time and energy to wait in the line for meat, I would have spent a small fortune. It's all Hallal meat, so it is slightly more expensive, but the quality can't be beat, and the variety is pretty amazing. Lamb, chicken, goat, beef, pork...and nearly every cut imaginable, including stomach and intestines, and fresh ripe red. I WILL be back to buy meat. \\n\\nThe market itself has it ALL to make a perfect Middle-Eastern meal, from rices and cous cous, sauces, tahini, rose water, spices and seasonings, and in a greater variety and price range than other markets like Labad's in the Strip (which turned me off after a rant by the owner about gay people - 'I'll take their money, but I don't want to be their friend' - well, they get none of my money).\\n\\nOnce home, I yanked off a chicken leg and thigh from the rotisserie chicken, and started dipping into the hummous. The chicken was perfect - juicy and beautifully seasoned in their own marinade - true yum.  The hummous was excellent for a basic hummous. I like mine a bit more on the garlic/lemon/olive oil side, but it certainly was not bland and boring, and the 'free' pita was perfect with it.\\n\\nMy friend messaged me that what she had gotten was just as yummy, and she had enough to last several days. I will definitely be trying her chicken dish out one of these days. And when I'm not watching carbs, that dessert counter will be raided.\\n\\nThe crowd was quite international, a breath of fresh air in da burgh, and I have to say, the Middle-Eastern eye candy - damned near as good as the food. But then, I've always been a sucker for a short, dark complected guy with jet black hair and a prominent nose. \\n\\nAnd I can't express enough - friendly staff. Helpful staff. \\n\\nClean atmosphere, stocked shelves, and even a sign that says 'Don't talk to the butcher when he's at the sawing table' - which means - fresh. It's being cut right then and there. \\n\\nAnd even better and more amazing in the Strip - they have their own parking lot. I look forward to exploring more, and doing some serious cooking in the near future!\\n\\nNow to just connect with that new habibi....\",\n",
       " 17: \"No-carb diet...meat, meat, meat...how do I love thee...let me count the weighs...\\n\\nI have to start off with I'm basically a poor secretary. I am also of German and Slovak blood lines...or blood clots, as the tendency to lean toward short and round is a constant battle to avoid. I do NOT embrace my muffin top or man-boobs, nor will I, and the only diet that I've found that works in keeping those at bay is the low-to-no-carb diet. This means...meat. \\n\\nI have gone around da burgh trying to find not only affordable for a meat heavy diet, but also GOOD. From the big bird scavengers, to the low end Save-A-Lots, and several mom and pops in between. NONE of them can compare to the taste and price (and that's the important combo here) of Strip District Meats.\\n\\nI used to work in the Strip, and got to know these guys pretty well, and I also got to know the ins and outs of shopping there.\\n\\nFirst, let's cover the selection. From your average steaks, chickens, and pigs. You want it, they've got it. And although they DO specialize in the hefty packs for the WIC crowd, they will give you what you ask for. Just ask them like they're people, and not like you're some uppity foodie. This IS the old time butcher shop from the 50's. You don't need ten pounds of wings? Ask for five. They'll give you five. \\n\\nTheir bacon is outstanding, and you can get it 'rind on' or 'rind off'. Their own recipe kielbasa is delish. They also have sausage, bulk or link, from breakfast to hot, that is very good. Hams. Beefs roasts. Pork roasts. Ribs. It's all there, and it isn't triple marked up like the big bird.\\n\\nIn the freezer coffers, they also have an impressive selection of exotic meats, from bison to ostrich to gator. Those prices can be a big heftier, but how often are you going to whip up a batch of Gator bites? (don't cringe. Cafe Tu Tu Tango in Florida, regular menu item, served with a spicy mustard sauce, and YUM. Yeah...tastes like chicken).\\n\\nThe staff is FANTASTIC...if you treat them like people. Be a jerk, you're going to get it right back. Henry, Lorenzo, Bee...kind, helpful, and good humans.\\n\\nHere's the trick. If you are an 'average Joe', do NOT go during prime shopping hours. Get there early on weekdays and Sundays, and avoid Saturdays. The earlier in the week, the better. This IS a shop that handles the WIC (formerly food stamp) program. The clientele can be unruly, rude, and plentiful. They will be on their cell phones, their children will probably NOT be watched, and they WILL be mouthy, aggressive and downright annoying. AND, if you get there later in the day, or in the middle of that rush, you WILL get the residual attitude from real people who have been dealing with that circus all day, all week, every week, every month.\\n\\nThink of it like avoiding the mall the day before Christmas. Use your brain.\\n\\nMy thing is chuck steaks. I like them a certain size, to be a meal, and I like them juicy and flavorful. I eat them medium rare, leaning toward rare.\\n\\nI have tried Aldi. They turned grey in the broiler. I've tried Save-A-Lot. They turned grey in the broiler. I tried Salem's Market, home of Halal. $35 for decent steak, but who can afford that regularly? I tried Foster's Meats in Lawrenceville. They we're slightly pricier, but the same quality. Then the owner killed himself in the cooler, and that was the end of Foster's. Giant Eagle. You want HOW MUCH? Forget that. Las Palmas in Brookline. Good steaks, but again, a $30 price tag. Anderson's in the Strip. Reasonable price, but they didn't even look like real meat in the package. Turned grey in the broiler. \\n\\nThree meal-sized chuck steaks at Strip District Meats, full of juice and flavor, fresh cut, beautifully pink in the broiler. Between $7 and $10 for the pack of three.\\n\\nTHAT'S what I'm talking about.\\n\\nAnd if rumor has it right, if you're there on the right day, the owner's son Ray just may give you one hell of a floor show!\\n\\nTruly, this is now THE only place I will buy my meats. I'm just smart about when. Timing is everything. And my 49 year old 'muffin top' fits just fine in a 32 inch waist, thank you VERY much!\",\n",
       " 18: \"Ok, after four or five visits, I can officially say that Burgatory is my number two favorite place in da burgh for excellent quality hamburgers!\\n\\nMy reason for going to any burger joint, or any other kind of eatery, is not for the atmosphere, my goal is to put quality food in my mouth.  Burgatory certainly puts an excellent piece of meat in my mouth!\\n\\nI've gone with a group of friends, and several times with single friends, and in the food I have never been disappointed.  From appetizers to burgers, everything has been plentiful, made exactly the way I liked it, made my tongue very happy, filled me up adequately, and didn't completely break the bank.\\n\\nI generally opt to build-my-own burger, with the brioche bun, and whatever toppings I happen to be in the mood for.  They don't skimp on the toppings, and they're fresh and yummy.  When building your own, you have a checklist, with several columns, from choices of meat, bread, rubs, cheeses, sauces, veggies, and a few more, most of which are pick one free, then add for additionals.  The three levels of cooking are 'red, pink, brown', and they indeed arrive how you choose it.  The burgers come automatically with fresh home made potato chips, but you can upcharge for some pretty spectacular fries, and they actually come in a big enough order to satisfy, not 'tease' like at BRGR. \\n\\nI've not had a shake, but I have tasted my friend's and yup...they're pretty yummy too, but I'm not much into spending money on uber-marked up booze anywhere.\\n\\nThe chicken wings are pretty darned tasty and plump, and the other appetizer I had at my recent visit were the Bangkok Steak Fries. Basically three HUGE portobella mushrooms cut in half, fried in a tempura batter, and served with a peanut dipping sauce.  These were absolutely incredible and so huge I though about taking part home, but ended up just stuffing myself before the burger came.\\n\\nThey are on Facebook, and you can see their daily specials posted if you 'like' them, and quite often I wish I was free on the days that some of those specials come through. They truly look exotic and amazing.\\n\\nI've had mixed experiences wit the service, from one gal who was about as apathetic as could possibly be - kind of a 20 year old Fox Chapel Barbie wannabee on Valium - to one boy who was determined to flirt his way into a bigger tip - but for the most part, including the most recent visit, the staff has been very professional and helpful, and efficient.\\n\\nThe only complaints I have are that the space can be cramped. Booths are great, and the hightop tables are fine, but sometimes sitting at a small two-top in the main dining area is a little too invasive with the folks right at the next table. Second can be the wait period.  They are BUSY during the usual main dining hours, and your wait can be two hours. Fortunately, you ARE at a mall, so if you've got some shopping to do, they will either text you or page you when your table is ready.  I suggest planning your visit for an off-time so that you can get in and get seated in a decent amount of time.  \\n\\nAnd final complaint, just from a personal place, ENOUGH with the ad-nauseum sports TV coverage. You've got 275 TVs lining the bars and the walls...can ONE of them have something other than mindless sports channels showing?\\n\\nBut generally speaking, Burgatory beats the pants off of BRGR, Tessaros, Round Robin, Five Guys, and any other place I've been in da burgh that lays claim to great burgers...except one. Winghart's in Market Square still hits my tongue as the 'best'.\\n\\nBut Burgatory, keep doing what you're doing. I'll be back.\",\n",
       " 19: \"I must admit that I went into this with 'pretentious bistroid' as my mindset, but going to the theater next door, thought I'd give it a try since it was closest.\\n\\nUpon entering, the visual I took in was pretty much 'pretentious bistroid'.  Another Pittsburgh joint trying to be all NY or LA in a city that will never BE NY or LA.  I'd eaten there once before when it was Cafe Zao, and the atmosphere wasn't quite as pretentious, but the prices were truly outrageous, which was kind of what I was expecting this time around.  I went for brunch, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that not to be so.\\n\\nI found a few things on the menu that looked intriguing for brunch, and the waiter, an older gentleman, was actually very kind and helpful, more so than the pretty little youth prancing around, noses in air, as if their mere presence was a gift to the diners.\\n\\nI was flipping between three choices, and the waiter helped me decide on the Corned Beef Benedict.  We split an order of the pate, and each got coffee.  \\n\\nFirst came the water, in kitschy bottles, poured by the waiter and left on the table. It's kind of a lame attempt at 'theming' but theming only works if you go all the way with it.  But when in Pittsburgh is anything ever taken to the enth degree, when 'meh' is viewed as fabulosity?\\n\\nNext arrived the pate in an adorable little mini-mason jar, complete with the dual snap lids. Again, really?  Cute, but highly unnecessary.  It was accompanied by two pieces of toast, cut in four, and the pate actually needed another slice of bread to match portioning.  However, the flavor and texture were very good.  A decent little appetizer.  \\n\\nThe coffee test passed. I never soil coffee with cream and sugar, even if it's REALLY bad. My friend however will use cream and sugar if it is weak.  She didn't have to.  The coffee was decent for a cup of Pittsburgh American Joe.\\n\\nBrunch arrived.  My friend had the short rib hash, and I had the Benedict.  The lunch dishes didn't match the attempted 'theming' (nor does the decor), and my friend (who is blind) took one bite from her little trendy dish and the food slipped over onto the table.  Again the waiter was extremely kind and helpful and brought her a real plate so she could eat without doing much damage.  \\n\\nThe food...bottom line...was very good.  Flavorful, not toy food (but not quite a Pittsburgh shovel full), filling, and done well.  \\n\\nThe server was not totally aloof (not chatty), but he was helpful and efficient without throwing an attitude.\\n\\nMy friend expressed an interest in dessert, and tried the chocolate mousse, which I did take a bite of, and it was really delicious.\\n\\nThe check came to around $48...not bad for an appetizer, two coffees, two entrees and a dessert in what is a somewhat 'upscale' type place.  \\n\\nI can't complain about the food or the price for lunch.  They surprised me very nicely.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint comes from the general atmosphere.  The seating is a long upholstered bench along the wall, with TINY marble tables, and an armless armchair on the outside of the table. Had the place been crowded we would have been sitting WITH the people at the next table.  Even with an empty table between us, we had to listen to the pretentious blurting of some food writer who was gushing all over the chef pretending that Pittsburgh was going to be the next gastronomical tourist destination...hate to break your heart sweetie, but Pittsburgh ain't going to be the next big tourist destination for ANYTHING until corruption money is funneled back into education, and yinzers stop partying like it's 1979.\\n\\nI didn't quite know what to do with my feet as they either were resting on the cast iron legs of the tiny table, or had to be spread wide apart to hit the floor.  One, the tables are too small and round for two for brunch, with water, drinks, a water bottle, sugar, creamer, flatware, side dishes...oh wait...it's ok...I have a lap. Two, I can't imagine this being more comfortable or accommodating for a larger dinner setting.\\n\\nThe attempt at 'theming' either needs to be polished to completion, or abandoned, because what they do have just looks silly in a highly over-designed architectural space. You want to go 'speakeasy', then do some research and go all the way. Otherwise, skip the kitsch and focus on what you clearly are doing pretty well...make good food at a fairly reasonable price.\\n\\nI can't say this would be a comfortable regular haunt, but I would go back for a somewhat special occasion.  Question is...do you want regulars, or special occasions in a VERY small market?\",\n",
       " 20: \"Without reading much of the previous reviews, we had an evening planned at the Turkish Cultural Center for a free Turkish film, and did a general scan for something interesting to eat in the neighborhood, and Casa Rasta caught our attention. I did glance through the reviews, and saw that there was quite a mixed bag, but we thought oh well, what the heck, let's decide for ourselves.\\n\\nMexarribean? \\n\\nSo the plan was to meet at 5:00 pm, and two of us got there just a few minutes before, still waiting on the third. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly Woody Allen-ish boy in a tie-dye t-shirt, who seated us just inside.  We checked out the menu, which look quite intriguingly enticing, and our server came over to take a drink order, and possibly encourage an appetizer.\\n\\nNow I see several reviews whining about bad service, and I have to say, I guess this was our lucky day...because the stunning young gal that took care of us was incredibly friendly and helpful. She was pretty, polished, helpful, well spoken, and FAR from the usual grunting yinzer, or angst ridden art school student. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our third to arrive, we ordered Yuca chips and guacamole, a Diet Coke (Yay, more Coke people) and a Ginger Beer. My friend had the ginger beer, and insisted that I try it, and I had to agree with him that it started out with a medicinal kind of blast, followed by a somewhat intense burning in the back of the throat. I stuck to my Diet Coke. Then suddenly Woody Allen shouted out my name from the bar, and said that our other friend was running behind, but would be there shortly. \\n\\nWe waited for the Yuca chips, and the server came over and said that she was very sorry it was taking so long, but that they were actually in the process of starting them all from complete scratch, fresh, even to the extent of shaving the Yuca into chips as we spoke. \\n\\nOur friend actually arrived just moments before the Yuca chips, and they were TOTALLY worth the wait. Sliced VERY thin and perfectly fried, and the guacamole would only have been fresher had they made it tableside. Very flavorful guac as well, not just thrown together. \\n\\nSo now it was time to place the order for the meal. David ordered a roasted pork quesadilla, Donald ordered a shrimp fajita, and I ordered a steak burrito. And shortly after we'd practically licked the guacamole bowl clean, the entrees arrived. \\n\\nDonald's eyes rolled back in his head after the first bite of shrimp, which were very nice size, and coated with the perfect amount of seasoning. He proclaimed them delish.  David moaned in delight on the first bite of the pork quesadilla, and again insisted that I try a nibble of the pork. I have to say, it was worth the moan, and a few extras. Beautiful seasoned, with a hint of coconut, good cheese, and TONS of flavor in the juicy pork. Not the usual dried out pork. This was excellent.\\n\\nThe steak in my burrito was juicy and nicely seasoned, and the burrito was a good meal size. My only complaint was that it didn't come topped with any kind of sauce, but our lovely server brought a couple of different bowls of salsa, one red and one green, freshly made, that I drizzled into the burrito as I munched it down to the nub. I would have liked a little more fire in my spice, but I completely understand where I am. So many Pittsburgher's cry when they simply SEE a bottle of hot sauce...put in a scotch bonnet? Not on their life. (and NO, it's NOT a hat!) So most foods here that would normally be a challenge to a spice loving tongue have been pandered down to please the pierogi tongues. \\n\\nAfter dinner, David opted for dessert, and was won over by the description of the home made hazelnut cheesecake, that the server told us the owner made herself. She described it as more like a mousse than a cheesecake, and she was right. It was spectabulous! My only suggestion to them on the dessert would be: COME ON! If you're going to make something THAT from-scratch scrumptious, put away that can of spray whipped cream! It's so easy to make shipped cream from scratch, and my goodness did that cake deserve that extra touch!\\n\\nThe place developed a very pleasant little crowd in the hour we were there, the server was always present and friendly, keeping the water and soda filled, and the dishes cleared, in addition to making genuinely helpful suggestions.\\n\\nThe bill for all that we ate only came to around $44, so this was really a very worthy stab in the dark new restaurant try. If we end up in that neck of the woods for another event at the Turkish Cultural Center, which I'm sure we will, Casa Rasta will be the first place we check into for dinner.\\n\\nVERY pleasant experience indeed.\",\n",
       " 21: \"I have to say that when venturing into the wasteland that is Homestead, one never really knows what one may find. It is great that someone is making an attempt to revive some of the multitude of vacant buildings which are rotting away two blocks from yet another mill-turned-mall. This neighborhood once had a short list of 'must visits'...and then came...the mall. And away went...the must visits. From my point of view, except for the usual strip mall shopping, there are only two 'draws' to the entire neighborhood. The movie theater, and the Carnegie Music Hall. And I really feel that Dorothy 6 will excel...when there's a show at the music hall. OR, in exceedingly rare cases, an intellectual winner at the megaplex movie theater that doesn't appeal to the mindless chain chow masses who only go to watch things blow up..\\n\\nDorothy 6 is a little architectural surprise in a mostly plywood-windowed run down area that USED to be a livable working class neighborhood. Exposed brick, chandeliers...a comfortable and only slightly pretentious bistroid setting. Definitely a bit out of place for the location, but a good start.\\n\\nA friend and I were on a night-out reprieve from a snowed-in week, and decided to try something 'different' that had been raved about by Yelpers.\\n\\nThe food? We had a stuffed meatball appetizer, which were four little meatballs stuffed with cheese and served with a dipping sauce of some sort. The meatballs were very good, and the dipping sauce was not any kind of distraction from the flavor of the meat.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, I'd had a late breakfast with another friend who took me to a place with a Reuben that was reported to be very good, but turned out to be just ok (as usual). And here at D6, there it was on the menu...a Reuben. Well, ok. Try TWO new ones in one day. So I ordered the Reuben with fries, and my friend ordered the Pierogi sampler.\\n\\nThe waiter was very pleasant and attentive in his hipster bearded and over-tatted way, and actually was very nice and efficient. He kept the Diet Coke flowing, which is an awesome thing.\\n\\nSo the food arrived, and the report is in. The pierogi were nicely and obviously home made, with quality ingredient stuffing. She had three flavors to sample. Cheese. beer and bacon, and Jalapeno. I tried a bit of one of the jalapeno, and it was very good. But I believe she had five pierogi for $13? We're not talking cover-the-plate pierogi. We're talking a little smaller than Mrs. T's, but made from scratch. Dough, potato, and just enough of the extra 'ingredient' (jalapeno, bacon, etc.) for a zing. $13 for five? A bit steep. They were very tasty. But not worth an hour of your average Pittsburgh working wage.\\n\\nThe Reuben was a little less in price, even with the fries, but again, failed the NY Reuben test. This and the lunch Reuben were very similar, except this one DID use dark rye, but very light on the meat, which is the reason for a Reuben. The fries were actually not very good at all, and really seemed like frozen pseudo steak fries from the Sysco truck. I didn't eat those.\\n\\nThe place has good service, and a comfortable atmosphere...but as I've said many times before, I go out to eat for...food. I don't eat atmosphere. And no matter how nice the server might be (even IF he slips me his phone number and says 'call me, daddy'), if the food isn't a huge wow, I probably won't be back to 'eat'. That being said, should the Carnegie Music Hall pull in another artist worth venturing into that neighborhood to see, Dorothy 6 certainly is one of the best choices outside of 'the mall', and a much better choice than anything chainey IN the mall.\\n\\nIt was a good place to hang out and talk. A better balance between food and price, and it would be a bigger winner.\",\n",
       " 22: \"After having seen the demise of two 'Soul Food' restaurants in this space over the course of four months, heartbroken that they couldn't make them go and missing the fried chicken like mad, I was happy to see something else 'small' open in this site. \\n\\nI had gone once with a co-worker and didn't actually order anything, but this past week decided to give it a go. I was sick of my leftovers, and wanted something different.\\n\\nI used to occasionally hit the Qdoba, and although they do tend to be big and flavorful, they also tend to be much bigger in price tag than they need to be. They recently eased up on that by making things that used to be outrageously 'extra' not extra, but a burrito still comes with a hefty price tag.\\n\\nBea's offers a basic line of Burritos, enchiladas, tacos and quesadillas. They have their own creations, and the basics. \\n\\nFor my first go, I opted for the basic 'original' burrito. I had a choice of meats, so I chose steak. (Actually, according to the hand written paper on the wall, I had my choice of 'meet'). \\n\\nIt was about the same size as Qdoba, stuffed with rice, beans, guacamole and steak, a little cheese, and came with a side of some kind of sauce that was tasty, though not too zingy.\\n\\nAfter I'd placed my order and paid, THEN I noticed another paper sign on the wall for nachos, but since I'd already paid, I decided not to try. They really could work on consolidating their signage a bit. \\n\\nI got my burrito back to the office and devoured it in about five minutes. \\n\\nAnd I am torn.\\n\\nThe price is about the same, now that Qdoba has eased up on their 'extras'. But the flavor, though pretty much probably bioengineered at a chain like Qdoba, IS more flavorful. \\n\\nBea was a little bland. They could toss in a few more seasonings and I'd be hooked. Kick it up with some true Mexican hot sauces, and I'd definitely be hooked.\\n\\nBut I suppose my bottom line...support local. Additionally, although I know the holiday spirit nonsense, I wasn't too keen about Qdoba giving a portion of sales to Catholic Charities this past year. That prevented me from going at all. \\n\\nBea does have seating, and everyone was very nice. The check out gal (Bea?) is a stunning woman reminiscent of early 80's new wave style. Another plus? The kitchen crew actually appears to be...Mexican, or at the very least of some Hispanic extraction. That's a plus. They also have a cooler stocked with a variety of Latin culture beverages, in addition to the usuals. They also take credit cards.\\n\\nSo flip that coin...but end its flight in mid-air. Buy local. Check out Bea's.\",\n",

       " 29: 'Some of the worst pizza I\\'ve ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn\\'t even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I\\'m serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \\n\\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \"steak\" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \\n\\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed.

       " 30: 'We took my dad to dinner here for his birthday. There were only 6 of us, and it was a Sunday evening - not too busy, but they seemed to be understaffed. We were able to be seated immediately, which was nice. All of the staff was very friendly. Those are about the only positive things I can say about our experience. \\n\\nWe all ordered appetizers. When the waitress brought them out she admitted that she had forgotten to put my dads order of stuffed mushrooms in. Actually, she didn\\'t even remember what he had ordered so we had to tell her again. \\n\\nMy appetizer was Cajun shrimp, which was WAY over seasoned. I couldn\\'t even see the shrimp underneath the thick crust of Cajun seasoning. It was at least 1/4\" thick, and had to be scraped off. But there was so much that I couldn\\'t even taste the shrimp at that point, only crusty dry chunks of seasoning. \\n\\nMy sister ordered oysters. She said they were not shucked/cleaned correctly, so there was grit in her oysters. \\n\\nMy dads stuffed mushrooms finally arrived well after salads. They didn\\'t discount them or take them off the bill or anything, which I find annoying since the waitress admitted she completely forgot them and they arrived about 30 minutes after they were ordered. \\n\\nAs for our meals, it was a series of mediocrity and mistakes. My steak, which was ordered medium, was served well, as was my fathers. I chose to send mine back, which meant I got my steak after everyone had already finished their meals. My lobster tail was chewy and the \"stuffing\" in it was not very good. My father said his scampi was \"okay\".\\n\\nMy sister ordered the Pasta Di Mare - which she said was basically pasta covered in olive oil, which was largely bland and unseasoned, instead of a wine sauce. \\n\\nMy other sister had the crab cakes, which she said were bland and dry.\\n\\nMy brother in law had the lobster roll, which seemed to be the winner of the night. He said it was decent. Not great, but decent. \\n\\nMy sisters fianc\\xc3\\xa9 ordered the seafood stew and he described the sauce as \"milk, with old bay seasoning in it.\" He said it was \"gross\". \\n\\nThe mashed potatoes were great, everyone agreed on that. \\n\\nI did see my sister pull a hair out of her salad dressing. \\n\\nI also had a big ol fly land, twitching, right by my plate as I was moving my steak.

One person in our group had a burrito and had the guac on the side.  The guac was fresh and very good, nice to be able to steal some and put on top of my burrito.

I went with a traditional American cheeseburger, while Christian, I mean, my husband, got the Gourmet burger. Both were cooked to our specifications (medium and rare, respectively), and were juicy and flavorful. No french fries here as sides, which is an interesting decision, and makes the experience more unique. Though we could have gotten something healthy, like steamed broccoli, we both went with the home fries. They were great: tender on the inside, crispy on the outside & flavorful. Because so many of the review focused on the burgers, we were surprised to see they have lots of other menu items, including fish & ribs. So, I plan to return and give some other menu items a try.

       " 74: 'Georgetowne Inn is a style, culinary and service abomination. Located at the top of Mt. Washington, it is perfectly situated for beautiful, romantic meals that should highlight all the wonderful things about Pittsburgh. Instead, it plays into all the old stereotypes some have about Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh food scene. \\n\\nEntrance: Parking can be difficult on Mt. Washington on weekend nights, so we paid the $5 valet service fee. No biggie, right, because we\\'re about to have a great meal. Besides who wants to walk 5 blocks in dress clothes, because Georgetowne Inn is \"dressy.\" Oh, wait, it\\'s actually not dressy. The hostess was wearing black stretch pants, and many patrons were wearing jeans, shorts, polo shirts, and tank or tube tops. Yes, I saw someone in a tube top. After we check in with the hostess, she proceeds to bring us to one of the worst tables in the place. When we express dissatisfaction and ask for another table, she says we\\'ll have to wait for a better table (despite many being open). But wait, I\\'ve had a reservation for 2 week now, doesn\\'t that mean anything? Silly Jill, having a reservation doesn\\'t actually mean anything! See, the good tables are first come, first serve-- duh!\\n\\nDecor: Oh, wow. Don\\'t get me wrong, there is a special place in my heart for restaurants that are old school. This place is just a joke. Firstly, it\\'s carpeted. Gross. Second, the interior looks remarkably similar to a Steak N Ale. Is it the renaissance in here? Why are there torturous-looking white spikes protruding from the walls and ceiling? How did you manage to get a toilet bowl that is peach with a white tank? These are things I cannot answer.\\n\\nOrdering: This is where the evening got really spectacular. After waiting for 5 full minutes (with no wine list), I ask the bread girl if she knew where our server was. Five minutes later the server shows up. No greeting, no nothing, just, \"Can I get you something from the bar?\" We tell her we have the Living Social deal that comes with wine. \"Oh, ok. Well, you have a choice between a red and a white.\" Jill: \"Sure. What are the grape varieties that we get to choose from?\" Server: \"Huh?\" Jill: \"What types of red and white wines do we get to choose from? For example, a pinot noir or a pinot gris?\" Server: \"Oh, I don\\'t know it just depends on the bar.\" Also, it blew her mind that my Living Social deal was on my phone, and she left with my phone for 5 minutes to figure out how to mark it used.\\nNow we get into ordering food. I\\'d been looking forward to escargot for weeks, and I happily ordered it as my appetizer. Surprise, they\\'re out of that and 3 other appetizers. OK. Meal order time. I\\'ll have the prime rib. Nope, out. I\\'ll have the crab cakes. Nope, out. I\\'ll have the stuffed shrimp. Nope, out. Just give me the damn steak.\\n\\nFood: The joke throughout the night was trying to figure out which aspect of the meal was going to give us life-threatening food poisoning. Neil made sure to tell me where the life insurance papers were kept. Raw oysters were served at room temperature. My seafood coquille was gross and looked like cat food. French onion soup looked like dirty dish water and was too salty to eat due to the insane amount of parm cheese. The spinach salad actually wasn\\'t half bad. The bacon dressing, though, did taste more like Bacos bacon than real bacon. Finally, the steaks. They were basically truck stop steaks. You know, they\\'re good because it\\'s a steak, but it\\'s not seasoned at all. We used copious amounts of salt, pepper and some of our blended red wine that remained to season it up. The pasta side was supposed to be in garlic butter sauce, and I tasted no garlic. The broccoli was disgusting and microwaved. Every single table that got broccoli sent it back untouched at the end of the meal.\\n\\n\\nOther gems: You could hear people yelling in the kitchen. Watching a man in gym shorts and a ratty tshirt deliver food to the bar.  Frozen butter.  Our waitress not being able to read the wine labels because \"she didn\\'t have her glasses on.\"',\n",

Significant portions of the dining area were also cluttered with empty beer and liquor boxes, and this preponderance of clutter made me wonder about the kitchen.  The service was fine, friendly.  The food really isn't that bad.  It's barrio Mexican, which is my favorite.  Word to the wise: when they say something comes with beef, they mean ground beef.  You have to ask for steak.  For example, the $11 big quesadilla with beef is a disgusting tortilla shoved full of ground beef and cheese.  You have to request sliced beef.\",\n",

I didn't think it would be too crazy expensive since the price of lobster is super low right now. Thankfully, the waitress told me how much it would cost before sending the order in-- almost $50!! Completely insane. I changed the meat from lobster to chicken. The dish came with 2 sides, and I got sauteed spinach and steamed broccoli. The people I was with got salads and bruschetta, all of which they enjoyed. Apparently they messed up another order, and we got 2 apps for free: crab cake and boiled shrimp. Both were good. The crab cake had a lot of meat in it, and the shrimp were seasoned and big. When my meal arrived, quite some time later, it was pretty tasty, and the portion was huge. Chicken with linguine and a vodka sauce. I thought it needed seasoning. The spinach and broccoli definitely needed seasoning. There wasn't even garlic in the sauteed spinach. Finally, we got an order of their creme brulee. It. Was. Terrible. Terrible!! The consistency was watery, there were nuts or something in it, and it was just bad. With a few minor changes to the food, namely seasoning, this place could be really great.\",\n",

The lobby of the hotel is really cool-- urban and chic-- and the restaurant decor continues in this vein.  The charcuterie plate was the stand out of the evening.  The \"small\" portion is loaded with cured meats, pates, little pickles and the fabulous bacon caramel.  The caramel was deep brown and sweet, loaded with chunks of thick-cut bacon.

We were told the wait was only 10 minutes and we were seated right away when we arrived! I don't believe this is something that happens frequently; we were very lucky. \\n\\nWe were seated right near the kitchen. Normally, I wouldn't be too fond of this, because of the foot traffic with servers and busboys etc, but with these huge, comfy, throne-like chairs, nothing was going to get me down.\\n\\nWe started with drinks, my boyfriend ordered the First Word and I ordered the Desperado. Both were really unique and enjoyable, with a swift kick. I suggest the Desperado only to people who really enjoy tequila, like me.

It was the best decision we've made, to date.\\n\\nWe had fried pickles (well, everyone else had fried pickles since I don't enjoy them, but they loved them.) We also had the fried Brussels. Oh my god, so good. And the dipping sauce was great, too! The tartare was different than any I've ever had before, probably because the meat was chunky rather than super ground down, but I really enjoyed it. The egg that accompanied it made the dish. The risotto was good, but probably the least successful of all the dishes. Texture wasn't that of an amazing risotto, but it tasted good. Lastly, the bone marrow. Oh my god . 3 huge half bones filled with creamy meaty goodness. I have dreamed about it quite often since my encounter with it. It was incredible. Also, it was only $14. Are you kidding? I'm from New York where this can be upwards of $30 and people would still pay. I was in shock.\\n\\nFor dessert we had some sort of cheesecake and bread pudding.

So when my mom came down to cash in on her Mother's Day gift, my sister and I decided to bring her here to eat first.\\n\\nThere was ample parking behind the building so no need to worry about finding a spot on the street.  Walking in, being that this restaurant is located in a old church, you feel as if there is a spiritual awakening about to happen.  And there is one about to happen.\\n\\nWhen you enter, make your seating selection wisely.  You can either sit by the bar, or in their 'dining area.'  Depending on what side you sit is the type of menu you are handed.  We chose the dining are and because we were thinking about the pizzas, we had to ask for the bar menu, even if it was just to look.  Also, don't forget to check out the board on your way in to check out the specials and what the untraditional pirogi are for the day.\\n\\nAfter looking over the menu, we opted not to have a pizza because we were afraid it wouldn't hold up in the car after we left here.  My mom chose the traditional pirogi with the homemade chips.  Sister decided on Yinzer Cheesesteak with fresh cut fries.  And I couldn't pass up the untraditional pirogi for the day: asparagus and cream cheese.  I also got a side of Belgian fries with lemon caper aioli.  These pirogi were amazing.  I was a bit worried at first when I saw the mixture, but totally surprise by how good the combo worked.  The Belgian fries hit the spot as well, the dip was a nice sweet combo.  My mom loved her traditional perigees and had so much of the chips left over they went home with her.  My sister's Yinzer cheesesteak looked good.  It's just a cheesesteak...Pittsburgh style, i.e. read that as a cheesesteak with fries and cole slaw on it.\\n\\nThe service was top notch here too.  The server knew every answer and was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  The hostess when we walked in and I asked a question about the untraditional pirogi did not know the answer but told me if I did get them, let her know how they tasted so she could pass it on to other customers.\\n\\nEverything in here is interesting to look at.

       " 88: \"First let me say that any restaurant that has fried pickles listed on the menu piques my interest.  Then to read on the menu that they make their own pickles in house was an extra bonus.  These pickles were thick cut and so favorable that I could probably have eaten a whole serving of just the plain pickles, but everyone knows that frying something gives it a little extra savory flavor. The coating they use was perfect, crunchy, and complimented the pickle itself.  The spicy ranch used as a side for dipping when added made this treat, for lack of a better term, perfection.  My god, my mouth is watering even now as I write this.  Enough with the pickles though.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at Meat & Potatoes a show was letting out at the Cabaret, so we weren't sure we would get a seat.  If we didn't there were more places to choose from in the Cultural District.  Luckily for us, when we walked in and were greeted by the hostess and asked if we had a reservation and our answer was no, we weren't turned away.  We were told that we could wait for a table or walk in and find a bar seat.  We opted for a bar seat, good choice.  Once we sat down we were basically tag teamed by the bartenders.  One was handing us a menu and telling us the drink specials as the other was pouring us a glass of water.  The menu is small, but that didn't make the decision making any easier...at all.  It was easy to pick the appetizers, fried pickles as mentioned before and we also got an order of poutine.\\n\\nSince I've already salivated all over myself, the keyboard and the floor because of the pickles, I really shouldn't write more about them.  I will focus on the poutine.  As it was said before by other reviewers, these are spiced to perfection and as I am going to say, melt in your mouth.  Imagine if you will if you decided to go to Kennywood to get some Potato Patch fries and instead you walk up and they were substituting Meat & Potatoes version instead.  Just take the Potato Patch fries and miniaturize them.  Fresh cut, fried up to a nice golden brown and tossed with some of the best spices you can imagine.  Cheese curd melted throughout and topped with some of the best gravy you can find.  These and the pickles could have been a meal enough for me, but you know I didn't stop there.\\n\\nWhile we waited for our entrees to show up, we had a libation as well.  I opted for the Erie Oatmeal Stout while my friend had herself a Moscow Mule.  Both were so satisfying, but I can tell you that the Moscow Mule was by far tastier with the combination of food we were having.  While we also waited for our food to come out the bartenders made chit chat with everyone that was seated around the bar. \\n\\nRecently I have been on a quest to find the perfect burger in the Burgh, so of course I opted for their Plain Jane burger.  I can say that this is one of the few places that can cook a burger to medium well and it tastes like it's cooked medium well.  Perfect portion of burger too, the patty was a little thicker in the middle but I wasn't worried about that.  Romaine lettuce, tomato, red onions and more house pickles to top the patty.  I also opted to add cheese, a nice white cheddar.  This time the pickles were sweet pickles and the mixture of taste with all the toppings was like a mouthgasm.  From the bun to the pickles I was very happy.  The burger was definitely an excellent decision to make that night.

I've been multiple other locations for Mad Mex, but never been to this location prior to my most recent yearning for Mexican food.  \\n\\nEven though parking is horrendous at this location being on a very busy street in Shadyside/East Liberty area, I still can't knock a star off for that.  Being here at a busy dinner time I expected to have at least a little wait.  Not so, we walked in, asked for a table for two and were seated immediately.  Almost immediately after sitting down our waiter was there to take our drink orders.  \\n\\nI'm a bit of a creature of habit when I visit a Mad Mex location.  I'm in love with the a la carte tacos.  I mean it's too hard to choose from beef, steak or chicken...so why not get one of each.  I'm still amazed that they offer soy cheese and tofu sour cream, still can't taste the difference.  Of course I was amazed by my Big Azz Margarita as always and who can deny starting with chips and salsa.  \\n\\nI loved how big it was in here too, lots of space to mingle about and great when the windows up front are opened.  Some outdoor seating is nice as well.  Very vibrant when walking in the area.\",\n",
       " 90: 'Wow, what a disappointment, I think I was jaded by my earlier experience here.\\n\\nI am quite confused but the inconsistency between each location.  And every year I always seem to run into the same problem.  No two location are alike, which cannot be a good thing.\\n\\nFirst, why do you feel the need to always sit a party of two in that row of tables that basically crams you into the lab of the person at the next table.  It\\'s not fun having to move your glass or plate every time someone gets up to use the restroom or leave.  \\n\\nSecond, what was up with our server?  It was like we were partially listened to the whole night.  I\\'ve had many good experiences with Mad Mex, but this server may have ended my kindness towards them and disrupted my return business from ever coming back.  I asked about a particular meal and she needed to consult her manager (I was coming here to redeem my birthday meal (good for up to $30)), she came back and said her manager was fine with that and then I proceeded to order.  When we got through with the order, it\\'s like deja vu.  She had to consult with her manager again.  But before we left, we had asked for chips and salsa.\\n\\nThird, the wait.  After the ordering debacle, we waited and waited.  After about ten minutes of not seeing our waiter again, I had to pull another waiter over and ask if he could send her our way with our chips and salsa.  Once she decided to grace us with her presence, she stated, \"you didn\\'t order this, I didn\\'t know you wanted it.\"  At this point, I\\'m getting hot, and it was from the spicy food.\\n\\nFourth, the food.  I had a chicken, steak and ground beef taco.  Opted for the soy cheese and tofu sour cream and some beans and rice.  Great to mix together.  The chicken was fine.  The steak, a little too well cooked for my liking even though I asked for medium.  And the ground beef, yuck.  It\\'s like they just scraped what was left in bottom of the pan and threw it on a tortilla.\\n\\nFifth, the price.  For my meal, which should have been free as it was under the $30 limit, I was still charge partly for it.  They only discounted $8 off my check.  Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'ll pay for my food, I\\'m not always a cheap bastard, but for the subpar food I just got, with the service that was almost nonexistent, I feel as I should have been compensated for more than $8.\\n\\nMad Mex, you let me down, badly.  My business can go elsewhere in the Shadyside area now, or maybe that can go for other locations as well.',\n",

But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven\\'t been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \\n\\nAfter having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we\\'re girls, it\\'s acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business?

Yes, that\\'s right....\"You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \"bathroom break\", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant.

The grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty, perfectly melty cheese.

This year, I chose to try Eleven with my husband.\\n\\nI did not put much effort into my outfit for my birthday and immediately regretted this decision when I walked into this beautiful restaurant. It's modern and trendy while still feeling classy and elegant. I wished there was a J Crew or Banana Republic next door so I could quickly buy a new outfit and redo my entrance.\\n\\nEven though I would have enjoyed experiencing the buzz of dining here on the weekend, we came here on a very quiet Monday night. When we first arrived, we literally had a large section of the 2nd floor all to ourselves. Our service for the entire evening was excellent! Our waitress was absolutely fabulous, and I believe her name was Liz. \\n\\nWith an impressive restaurant space and excellent service, I hoped that dinner would absolutely knock my socks off. It was very good, but didn't absolutely blow me away. Though everything was solid and well executed, I did not have anything so delicious that I've been dreaming about returning to have those items again.\\n\\nWe started with the Jumbo Lump Crab Crack, which was very tasty and had a nice balance of crab meat. My husband decided to go big and ordered the Prime Beef Ribeye. The cut of meat was enormous, but I thought that for $52 the flavors and tenderness could be better. As I had a free birthday entree coupon, I decided to have the Chef's Tasting Menu. The menu changes from time to time, but I had Tuna Tartare and Jubilee Hilltop Ranch Strip Steak. Sadly, I can't remember the 2nd course (even though I took a picture of it!). For dessert, my waitress said that I could order something not on the Tasting Menu, so I went for the Banana Cream Pie. Once again, everything was good, but for the price, none of my food was so incredible that I want to go back asap. My favorite item the entire meal might have been the Banana Cream Pie, which was beautiful, unique, and delicious.\",\n",

Though I work in South Side Works, I haven't eaten here in over a year so I was happy to come back and get a fresh perspective of the restaurant, especially since my previous opinion was pretty indifferent. \\n\\nThe customer service was good. A table for 10 was set up in a nice section of the restaurant before we arrived. We were promptly seated and had an efficient waitress. All went smoothly with service except confusion over who received which entree. Three co-workers ordered the same meal but with different substitutions, and each person received the wrong entree which resulted in some confusion and awkwardly passing plates of food around the table to correct the issue. \\n\\nI ordered the Ham & Brie sandwich with Blue Cheese and Apricot preserves and a side of Sweet Potato fries. The fries were very tasty - though is it possible to make Sweet Potato fries not tasty? - but I was disappointed in my sandwich. The bread had been toasted/grilled unevenly. One side was brown and crispy while the other side was mushy and buttery.  The sandwich was loaded with ham but only had a small slice of Brie. The blue cheese was nonexistent, and I could only taste the apricot preserves in a couple bites. \\n\\nI have a couple co-workers who are obsessed with the scallops and crab cakes here at McCormick... But as a restaurant option near many corporate offices, they should offer a great lunch. However, though they try to be creative, I would still rather get a sandwich or salad at Panera than pay 50% more here.\",\n",

       " 97: \"First, let me preface my review by saying that I am not a Mexican food fan. I have Cuban and Puerto Rican family and really prefer these cuisines over Mexican. When I found out that my workplace's dinner to Il Pizzaiolo was changed to Las Velas, I was pretty disappointed. \\n\\nMy coworkers and I started off dinner with drinks, and I selected the House Margarita. Personally, the drink was a bit strong in alcohol yet way too sweet. For food, we started with appetizers for the whole group; chips with guacamole and salsa dotted the table. This was actually my favorite part of the meal. The chips were perfectly salted and crispy. The guacamole was mild and smooth while the salsa provided a fire roasted kick. \\n\\nThough we were a large group, dinner took a very long time, approximately 1 1/2 hours from ordering to serving. We quickly became antsy, especially since our meetings started very early the next morning. We saw folks around us sit down and enjoy their food as we were still waiting for ours. Eventually, our food emerged from the kitchen, including my steak fajitas. The steak was a little chewy and tough while the tortillas were a bit hard. The leftovers have been sitting in my fridge, and I have little motivation to finish them.\",\n",
       " 98: 'I\\'m so thankful that my husband and I stumbled upon this little place! We used to take all of our out-of-town guests to Primanti, which is more about the \"Pittsburgh experience\" than the food in my opinion, but Szmidt\\'s is going to be our new go-to spot for visitors. Why? Because they are all about the amazing quality and large quantity of food for a reasonable price!\\n\\nWe brought seven different guests here over the summer, and they all absolutely loved it. My best friend said she was \"just a little hungry,\" but less than ten minutes later, she had inhaled one of Szmidt\\'s enormous sandwiches! \\n\\nAll of the sandwiches are delicious, and I can personally attest to the amazingness of the Joe, McCarthy, and Frankie. I am also obsessed with their pierogies and have tried the Potato & Cheddar, Southwest Chicken, and Cheese Steak. I think my husband (reviewer Will B.) sneaks over here a lot more than he lets me know during his lunch break.... But when he does let me know, I request some Potato & Cheddar pierogies, my ultimate comfort food.\\n\\nThe owner has also told us he would like to open an additional location in South Side Works. Please do! As a SSW employee, I am so tired of eating Qdoba, Subway, and Pita Pit... every. single. day. We need a great local spot like Szmidt\\'s!',\n",
       " 99: \"My husband and I were very behind in trying Meat and Potatoes (so behind actually that we tried its newer sister restaurant Butcher and the Rye first), and we finally checked it out tonight before our Alton Brown Live show at the Benedum.\\n\\nI had heard over and over again, particularly when Meat and Potatoes first opened, that the staff was underwhelming. Though they exceeded my extremely low expectations, I must admit that this restaurant receives 4 stars (and not 5) from me because of the staff that I encountered. The best analogy for me is to think of the sales associates (or should I say models) at Abercrombie. They will ring up your purchase, but they will not do it with a smile or go the extra mile. However, when I'm paying nearly $100 for a meal for two (drinks, appetizer, entrees, dessert, and tip), I expect my waiter to have a better personality than an A&F employee.\\n\\nThe second, but more minor, reason for my 4 star review is the seating. Though the restaurant is beautiful aesthetically, the made-for-2-people bench seat with accompanying miniature round table and chair is very teeny. This compact seating reminds me of restaurants in New York City and is not something that I want to experience in Pittsburgh. Plus, we were sitting a bit too close to a drunk woman ranting loudly to the strangers sitting immediately next to her about her ex-husband and his numerous infidelities and addiction issues.\\n\\nHowever, despite these few flaws, I had a great dinner. We started with the Wild Mushroom Risotto appetizer. It was warm and rich and full of flavor. I would definitely order this dish again, though I do believe that it had a tad too much salt. For our main course, my husband ordered the Pot Roast, while I went with the Hudson Valley Duck Breast. The two bites of Pot Roast that I tried were very pleasing. The dish was homey and flavorful and appeared to be a great portion size. Overall, I enjoyed the Hudson Valley Duck Breast but did think that it had some opportunities for improvement. The little dandelion green salad on the plate seemed a bit unnecessary. However, it was descent tasting, particularly the pickled onions on top.  The sauerkraut pierogies on the dish were a major disappointment to me. They tasted pretty one-note and could have used some sort of sour cream sauce on top to improve the flavor. However, the star of the dish - the pastrami crusted duck - was perfection! The duck was cooked rare/medium rare (just the way that I like it) and perfectly seasoned. By the end of the meal, I was too full to finish and felt absolutely devastated to leave two slices of duck sitting on my plate.\\n\\nWe had allowed two hours for dinner before our show, so since we were finished in only 45 minutes, we decided to order a dessert. Though I'm sure the desserts change frequently, I do wish that the restaurant would print a small menu with the options. I had a tough time remembering all the options when the waiter listed them for me and also couldn't see the distant dessert sign on the wall. We selected the Baked Chocolate Mousse that was out-of-this-world delicious. I have to say that it was my favorite item of the evening, with the duck in a very close second.\\n\\nThough I may have sounded critical throughout this review, especially since having the meal-of-my-life at Butcher and the Rye just a couple weeks ago, I do have to say that I enjoyed my first Meat and Potatoes experience, and it definitely won't be my last.\",\n",
       " 100: \"The food at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is literally other-worldly. I'm so happy for the Yelp event that introduced me to this restaurant!\\n\\nMy coworker and I came here for her birthday in late January. We were a little surprised to walk into the restaurant and find seating for less than 10 people. Thankfully, a lot of people ordering were picking up takeout to take back to their offices, so we were able to snag some bar stools.\\n\\nWe began chatting it up with the... owner? I forget... who had also been at the Yelp event several months prior, telling him that we had to check out the restaurant after tasting the food at the event. He is such a friendly, outgoing, eccentric kind of guy and is a lot of fun to talk to. He told us all about Gaucho's expansion plans. I can't wait for Gaucho to take over the neighboring space so that there will be more seating in the restaurant.\\n\\nLet's get to the food... We ordered Steak Empenadas, Provoletta, Vegetales, Rosemary Braised Beef Sandwich, and Camarones. Even though we had enough food to feed 5 people, we somehow inhaled almost all of it. The Steak Empenadas were wrapped in a flaky pastry and filled with a flavorful steak mixture. The Vegetales were tasty, roasted vegetables covered in balsamic vinegar. The Camarones were flavorful shrimp cooked in simple seasonings. My friend ordered the Rosemary Braised Beef Sandwich, but since I'm not a horseradish fan, I only stole a bite or two and let her enjoy the rest. The only item that didn't totally knock my socks off was the Provoletta. There was nothing wrong with the dish - toast covered in provolone with arugula on the side - but it just didn't impress me like the other items did.\\n\\nThe food was so good that we just couldn't resist getting dessert. When Gaucho heard that it was my friend's birthday, they gave her the Alfajores cookies. We didn't try them until we had returned to work that afternoon, and they were the perfect hit-the-spot melt-in-your-mouth afternoon treat. The Panqueques were sweet crepes filled with a whole lot of caramel and topped with chocolate drizzle. This dessert just requires a love of caramel! The Crema Quemada - aka Creme Brulee - was perfectly smooth and creamy and crunchy.\\n\\nI can't wait to return to Gaucho and bring my husband here to try all the delicious food. He was disappointed that I came without him, and I know that he'll be blown away the same way that I was.\",\n",

My husband made reservations finally after we tried their food at the Best Restaurant Party.  The decor is neat and the hostess was nice.  Our waitress was kind of odd and I didn't think she was listening half the time.  We tried the conch hushpuppies that were really good (I hate seafood and I loved them).  The sauces with them were amazing.  My husband got the flanksteak with yucca cakes.  It was also cooked very well and tasted great.  I got the burger, mostly because I saw someone else and it looked tasty.   It is a large burger (too big to eat without a fork and knife) and and it comes with a medley of root vegetable chips (but I asked for waffle fries).  My burger was burnt to a CRISP and tasted like it was on a charcoal grill too long.  I loved the sauce, but the waitress forgot to put in the waffle fries so I got the chips.  She did fix it when I brought it to her attention but then I got 1/3 of a tasting cup of ketchup which I thought was kind of strange.  So....  there were definite highlights (appetizer and my husband's meal) but my burger and the waitress was much to be desired.

End this journey with a trip through sweets and get the awesome creme br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e!!  \\n\\nCorporate entity or not, the Sunday Brunch Buffet is one to go out of your way for if you live or are visiting in Pittsburgh.

       " 114: \"If you visit the Pittsburgh area and you're close to The Waterfront, West Mifflin, Downtown or Monroeville area, it's worth the trip to a little place called Perrino's.\\n\\nPerrino's is a little market primarily for the community, but the creativity and charm of this place will keep you wanting to come back for more. Every day at 6A.M. they have breakfast options from fresh homemade breakfast sandwiches to breakfast pizza as well as lottery, drinks and everything in between, but it's at noon when things usually kick off.\\n\\nAny day of the week you can find fresh, crispy, pizza creations by the New York sized slice. From classic concoctions like Pepperoni, Mushroom and Plain to the Frankenstein creations like Big Mac Pizza, Reuben Pizza, Pierogi Pizza, Roast Beef & Cheddar Pizza, Steak and Cheese (with fries on it) Buffalo Chicken and the hole gets deeper, (trust me you'll wanna go as far down the hole as possible). They have fantastic Burgers with the same creative flair with toppings and fillings and even do fresh cut fries made like the famed potato patch fries at Kennywood. They have fresh salads, crispy chicken, hoagies made with care and just the right amount of toppings. The menu would turn this review into an encyclopedia, just know, you're going to have multiple trips.\\n\\nThe surprises of Perrino's daily specials is where you really get that loyal customer value. Always new one off creations from fresh sandwiches, experimental pizza toppings and fresh revolving deli.\\n\\nFamily owned and operated, this place is perfect for breakfast lunch and dinner. With their new renovations in 2014 and the extra staff on hand, it makes it a relaxing environment to eat and talk with the locals. It's more personal than we are used to in the digital age so don't be surprised to see teens hanging out, regulars getting their daily necessities and laughing and jokes by the staff. It's a lot like those markets on movies you wish you could visit.\\n\\nNow go check out Perrino's!\",\n",

The salad looked thrown together and was $5.49 for 2 croutons, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and chicken breast. (They forgot the cheese!) The staff wasn't very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didn't want to be there. There usually is a long wait at Steak 'n Shake, but if you catch them when they aren't busy, you will breeze through- drive-thru that is. I do like their food and you can eat healthy options, but the staff isn't helpful and the quality isn't always there.\",\n",

There is a train (complete with vintage ads and posters!) in the left portion of the restaurant that patrons can have dinner in, which is an absolutely amazing experience! The food is always pretty good and there are deals for certain days of the week that your wallet will thank you for. And let's not forgot to mention the mouth watering sourdough bread and garlic butter! It is so amazing and addictive! The wedding soup is phenomenal! Though, I most recently ordered steak and vegetables, and the presentation was thrown together and unappetizing. There were two small pieces of random steak on my plate, as though they were leftovers. The waiter was odd and rude. He asked if the birthday dessert was on my boyfriend's dad in front of the whole dinner party. Usually, most restaurants will give you a little something for your birthday, or at least be a little less blunt about the cost of the dessert. I wouldn't recommend sitting by the door that the staff comes out of either. It's really loud and they will have full conversations right by your table. Other than those two experiences, I've had a great overall experience at Spaghetti Warehouse and would recommend it to others!\",\n",

The food is delicious and they serve up big portions at a fraction of the cost of other big name restaurants! And if you are ever feeling the desire to go all out, do not hesitate to indulge on one of their amazing desserts! I recently ordered the Heath bar cheesecake and it was amazing- smooth, delicious and full of chocolate and butter toffee flavor. By far, the best cheesecake I've had- better than Cheesecake Factory and much cheaper! The ambiance is great. It's dim indoors usually, unless the sun is shining through the ceiling window. The staff is friendly and the service is great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a big meal with a reasonable price!\",\n",

Yokoso is one of the only hibachi restaurants I know that has separate, isolated seating for big groups of people with a cooking area all to its self! This is nice because sometimes you want to enjoy hibachi without being seated with strangers. The ambiance is very nice- dimply lit with a funky vibe to it. The staff is team \"Yokoso\" so don\\'t bring up Benihana! :-P It is nice to see staff that truly believe in their work and the quality of work that their company brings to the customer. I give this place 5 stars- it is clean, it is updated, and the food is always wonderful! Even if you had designated hibachi favorites in the \\'Burgh, please give Yokoso a try! You won\\'t be disappointed!',\n",
       " 119: 'I\\'ve gone to Meat & Potatoes twice and ordered the bone marrow appetizer ($18) both times. It is definitely an experience I believe everyone should try. At first, it is really hard to wrap your head around the concept, but once you do it, you realize the buttery steak taste is something you can get no where else. By the second time you order this appetizer, you are desensitized to the idea of eating marrow and it is not as big of a shocker. The menu options range from appetizers, salads, flat breads, burgers, sandwiches, pasta and main courses. I ordered the waldorf salad and it was wonderful! It tasted like a fresh picked mixtures of lettuce, fruit and \"green goddess dressing.\" I also ordered the \"Meat & Potatoes for Two\" (34 oz ribeye), which I wasn\\'t too impressed with for $59. I would get it again for the experience though, seeing as how it\\'s a 34 oz ribeye to share and isn\\'t too common of a experience at other restaurants I\\'ve been to. Although exotic, their drinks are not very tasty. I ordered the \"25th hour\" drink ($9) which had lavender agave in it, but I didnt taste much lavender. It was a dry tasting, bitter drink. I would be open to trying more drinks though. As far as going for dinner, the place gets cramped (tables/seats are pretty close together) and there are an overwhelming amount of people at the bar. Getting to the bathroom is a challenge when the people at the bar won\\'t move aside for you, which can be irritating, but this would not keep me from going at dinner time! I do recommend this place to someone who is willing to try a fancier, exotic restaurant with a great price for the quality, but if it is a first time, I would recommend lunch time to genuinely experience the food and a calmer environment.',\n",

I wish I had taken a picture of the happy hour menu. It\\'s ordered by price ($3.99, $4.99, ect) & everything is under $6 or $7. There are a few options for each price category. They have nice options too! The drink menu is similar. During my first trip, I ordered a margarita. Last night, I had a glass of Chardonnay & Bobby enjoyed a glass of Merlot. Don\\'t judge us, we know it was \"bottom-shelf\" wine for the price that we paid, but we enjoyed it, haha! \\n\\nLast night, I ordered the burger & fries ($3.99!) I enjoyed my meal and bobby enjoyed his calamari. \\n\\nYou\\'re missing out if you\\'ve never experienced their happy hour! It\\'s from 5-7pm M-F',\n",

My friend Brandi and i stopped in on saturday. we were on the hunt for st patricks day shirts in the strip and she let me decide on where to have brunch since im a yelper n'at. I had a few places in mind, but I remember walking by Kelly O's during the burgh bash and ive wanted to try it since then.\\n\\nWe arrived around 130 but still decided on breakfast. We informed our server it was our first time here, and she gave great suggestions. They have specials daily. A few from Saturday were: pierogi and cheese omelet, philly steak omelet, oreo pancakes.. I decided on the breakfast burrito. It's huge and inside you'll find eggs, home fries, onions, peppers and cheese. You can add a side of sour cream for 50 cents or meat for $1.50-$2. i went with sweet sausage. I also ordered a side of shredded potatoes with green peppers and onions because i love eating them as a side :) My friend Brandi ordered the french toast which is topped with cinnamon sugar. She ordered the home fries and said that they were very well seasoned.  \\n\\nWe sat near where the cooks let out the food. everything looked great! Waffles, huge salads, omelets. We are super excited to head back!\",\n",

Am i the only person who didnt know that, lol. It was a great surprise. I ordered my chicken strips (3) with the welch cheddar dip. The chicken was tasty and you can tell that its hand-breaded. I did really like it-- but I have had a few times where i find it too salty.. whether its too much seasoned salt, garlic salt or regular salt im not sure.. but it tastes a tad toooo salty (same with fries) The welch cheddar is a GREAT dip, but i wish they gave you more :( its those tiny little cups. I could scoop half a piece of chicken in it and use it all. Im a condiment person :D\\n\\nOne time, Bobby ordered the steak pot pie and added mac & cheese on top (munchie food at its finest) That was reallllly good! Great pot pies from this restaurant. Oh, another time bobby had the oysters and chips. He really liked it. I'm personally not a fan of oysters. i tried it and the breading was tasty :p \\n\\nThey have nice hours too.. I've been here on a Saturday at 1:45am. They informed us that they closed at 3am- kudos to those workers!\",\n",

After 3 awkward bites of bread, mayo & lettuce (ick), I open my half sub to find 4 measley pieces of chicken.. & not chicken strips.. just chopped chicken. oh yeah there were a few more (maybe 5 total) of pieces of ham the size of my brittle nonexistent fingernails.\\n\\nSo if you enjoy lettuce subs then you'll love it here for lunch.\",\n",

I'm not sure how much alcohol was in the original margarita because I wasn't really buzzed for having a beer mixed in a margarita but on a positive note, it tasted great. The rooftop bar is also really cool so check it out before the snow comes!! The service was also good. Bobby accidentally spilled my cup of water which went all over the table and floor. Our server as well as one of the food runners rushed over to help us.. well basically they cleaned and mopped all up while we sat there embarrassed.\\n\\nThe average... the food! I'm not saying the food is terrible by any means. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and Bob ordered the steak- I know, you're not supposed to order the same thing while going out but it stuck out to both of us. You get 3 (small) enchiladas as well as rice and black beans. My chicken enchiladas were average but Bobby's steak ones were really tasty. The thing is.. they servings just arent big. While heading home, we chatted that while it tasted ok, it felt as if it was an appetizer. Most places you are so full that you take some home but this isn't the case. We were finished and barely full... Idk I guess you have to go and see for yourself. Next time, we will order an appetizer before our meals. \\n\\nSince we live so close, we will most likely try it again and i'll update.\",\n",

Some of my fav things up there were the bloody marys from Bakn, steak skewers from Soba (amazingggg), liquor from Faber Spirits Bar, delicious cookies from Gluten Free Goat and Caricature drawings (loved it!). For entertainment upstairs we had the pleasure of listening to the Boilermakers Jazz Band, watching some awesome swing dancers and also a few burlesque dancers (didnt expect that at alllllllll!) \\n\\nThe vendors that I mentioned are only a handful of what was actually offered.

Their first attempt at my meal, grilled cheese steak burger melt(in essence a steak burger on a grilled cheese), I was served just a plain grilled cheese.

Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\\n\\nThey have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. \\n\\nIt is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. \\n\\nThe biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night.

As a former resident of the small friendly neighborhood of Friendship I visited Tessaro's many times and always wondered why I ever ate a burger outside my own house anywhere else.  They are fantastic, the meat  mixture is juicy, fresh, and has tons of good beef flavor.  The buns are warm and don't mess with the top billing.  The toppings compliment, but never overpower and the side of home fries is perfect in a sublime sort of way.  By far my favorite combo for a Tessaro's burger is one with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon, provolone, and mayo.  Cliches be damned this is a God send for a mouth.

I was honestly a little let down all around! Maybe I just need to come back for brunch as that seems like what everyone is raving about. \\n\\nFirst off the service was very lacking. Took too long to get our drink orders, and over an hour for our meals. There was 3 of us and 2 ordered fish and the other ordered a rare steak. No reason to take over an hour for that. Our sides of vegetables came out cold and my friends meal was obviously sitting under a heat lamp for a while. My meal was warm, not hot,  but it was still ok. My fish was prepared well and the rissoto was amazing! \\n\\nThe best part were the appetizers! We had the dynamite shrimp and bruschetta. The shrimp were so big and cooked perfectly. Honestly some of the best shrimp I've ever had! The bruschetta was also one of the best appetizers I've ever had. I would say it's more of a salsa though as it is served as a pile in the middle of 6 pita triangles with goat cheese. It was delectable none the less!\",\n",

That was quick and easy! \\n\\nWe arrived at 7 and we're brought right to our table. The hosts were super friendly and ours told us a little about the restaurant and decor. \\n\\nOur waiter arrived and he was amazing! Seriously top notch service, which should be at a place like this, but I had never had this type of experience. He was so funny and knowledgeable and gave us the perfect amount of time to decide what we want. He also brought over the cool meat tray so we could see the meats they have to offer. We ordered the kobe beef sliders, crispy pork belly, and foie gras for appetizers. Everything was delicious as expected. The foie gras was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. I was hesitant to try it at first but it is so so flavorful and delicious! If there is one appetizer you try make it this! \\n\\nFor dinner I ordered the filet, my boyfriend had the beef short rip, and the other couple ordered the seafood mix and porterhouse steak. We ordered fingerling potatoes and truffle Mac for sides. Everyone ate every last bit! Steak was cooked perfectly and was so delicious! \\n\\nFor dessert we both had the sticky toffee pudding. OMG can I just eat this 24/7? Gooey, chocolate, crunchy, melty, everything you dream of goodness! \\n\\nI hope I can come back here next time I'm in Vegas, if for nothing else the dessert!

Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\\n- None of the food was super awesome.

Five celebrated a special occasion together this afternoon....Eleven made it even more special.\\n\\nWe started off with the roasted beet, Belgian endive, Maytag blue cheese, hazelnut salad.  It was beautiful!  Gorgeous jewels of golden and ruby beets sprinkled with soft, salty and sharp bleu cheese, crisp, crunchy endive, sweet hazelnuts, lovely apples and a drizzle of molasses vinaigrette started us off beautifully.  \\n\\nEntrees....well, 4 out of 5 voted for the strip steak salad and all raved about the beef!  I opted for the lobster roll sans the roll, please.  Beautiful mesclun, which I understand was the first of the season and locally grown, was piled high with succulent chunks of Maine lobster dressed with a fresh lemony vinaigrette.  The lobster had been cooked perfectly...tender and sweet.  Absolutely heaven.  Oh!  And the housemade, fat dill pickle rocked.  Mmmmmhhhmmm.\\n\\nOn to dessert.  We were a little more diverse in dessert selection, but only marginally.  3 out of 5 ordered the molten lava cakes that were accompanied by hazelnut ice cream - housemade, of course!  All three wore happy little chocolate smiles the rest of the day.  Our 4th was all smiles over the apple crumble pie with roasted cinnamon ice cream and I....well, of course I had the creme brulee.  In this case it was pumpkin creme brulee.  Warm, toasty spices infused the lovely, soft custard with that gorgeous, crunch of bruleed sugar on top.

Well, never mind the bad joke, because the food and drink were heavenly. \\n\\n I started with the Monkey Business hard shake....dark rum and banana liqueur all blended up with bananas foster and ice cream, topped with THICK, luscious whipped cream and crunchy banana chips.  Kinda like eating dessert first, but is that a bad thing?  I thought not.  There was plenty left over to take home as you not only get the great big glassful with the great big straw, but you also get the metal shake container with all the goodness that didn't fit into the glass.  \\n\\nThe burger!  The Buffaloed Bison burger struck my fancy....and I was not disappointed.  It isn't easy to find a JUICY bison burger - sometimes they can be dry, but this one oozed juices.  I ordered it medium so it was beautifully pink on the inside and crusted and crunchy on the outside.  Perfectly cooked!  Buffalo cheddar and ranch dressing carressed the top of the burger and down the sides.  No bun because of the gluten issue, but the bun was unnecessary - it was perfect just as it was.  \\n\\nHad the review been based on the burger alone, there would have been a solid 5 stars.  The sides, however, were lackluster.  I had the slaw - eh, I've had better.  It was too fine, too runny and too oniony.  I wish I could have tried the chips or fries, but they don't have a separate fryer for chips and fries from the breaded items.  That's a gluten-free no no.  Please, Burgatory, dedicate a fryer to non-breaded items.  In fact, my dining companions were unimpressed with the chips...maybe a dedicated fryer would improve those?  \\n\\nThe hubby and another diner both had the Morty's Steakhouse burger and raved about it!  Hubster said the cabernet sauce made the burger.  He ate every single last bite.  The rest of the table shared onion rings to start off the meal - they said they were okay.  No raves there.  Our 4th companion had a basic cheeseburger with tomato and said it was an outstanding burger.  \\n\\nAll in all, a very good time and good meal was had by all.

Here I go with superlatives again, but the shortrib hash with poached eggs drizzled with horseradish hollandaise was, without a doubt, absolutely stellar!  Rich, melt-in-your-mouth, succulent shredded shortribs melded together with creamy potato cubes.  Perched atop were two perfectly poached eggs whose yolks, when pierced by a fork, enveloped the hash in creaminess only surpassed by the final crowning glory of a zippy housemade horseradish hollandise.  Superb....I've been fantasizing about them ever since.  \\n\\nThe hubby enjoyed a plate of chicken and waffles.  You may recall he ordered the same thing at Alchemy & Ale recently...Meat & Potatoes makes chicken and waffles the way they SHOULD be made!  Crisp, crunchy, JUICY, ON THE BONE chicken pieces piled atop a crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside cheddar jalapeno waffle kissed with bacon bourbon maple syrup.  Ooooooo....maple. Bacon. Bourbon.  \\n\\nWe each had a specialty drink - me the Bacon & Egg - a blend of bacon vodka, orange juice, sugar and egg white.  The bacon vodka was a house infusion that packed more bacon punch than the Bakon brand I have in my bar.  I am going to try my own bacon infusion again!  The drink was interesting, but next time I want all that bacon-y goodness in a Bloody Mary!  \\n\\nFond memories of San Remo and Monte Carlo meals always ending with Fernet Branca enticed the hubster to order a Kingston which included Drambuie and Fernet Branca along with pineapple juice.  He enjoyed it, but enjoyed his Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat Ale even more!  He IS a pumkin ale fan.\\n\\nThe brunch prices here are amazingly reasonable!

I first sampled an Ultra L that was chocolatey yet light - white chocolate liquor, fresh lemon juice, gin, avocado (makes it smoooooooth!) and Aztec chocolate bitters (just a few of the ingredients)...absolutely delightful!  A friend had the Dirty Blonde which incorporated vodka, olive brine, pineapple and jalapeno and garnished with bleu cheese stuffed olives....only for those who love a really dirty martini....we started calling it the Filthy Blonde!

Browned and crisp on the outside - not breaded to achieve the crispiness, no, pan seared and browned!  It was topped with arugula, shavings of parm and truffle oil.  It was my favorite bar snack of the night!  The crispy polenta cakes were good, too...maybe needed some shavings of parm and/or a little side of marinara to dip....but still quite nice.  I wasn't able to sample the pasta and meatballs, but my companions RAVED!  Fresh, homemade pasta, mind you!  They also order a pizza with house-made mozzarella and fresh basil...they loved it...especially the mozz.  \\n\\nAnd they have a sushi bar, too!  Imagine that.  Another of our dining companions enjoyed a sushi selection that even included a quail egg...it was gorgeous.\\n\\nI can't give a complete review for a couple of reasons.  1. The upstairs club area will open the weekend after the 4th of July - I hear great things...including having a see-through floor! 2. The outside Sand Bar that will have SAND and tropical surroundings, steel drums and tropical drinks isn't yet open either...it, too, will open the weekend after the 4th.  3.

After all, when I was a kid this area of town was hopping with steel mills, thriving shops, and even a once regal theater. I am always thrilled to see someone trying to do something positive here. But it takes more than the hook of memories. \\n\\nNostalgia lines the walls, the rafters, and even the bar. Artifacts of glorious steel days gone by are the backbone of Dorothy's decor. The spot is both warm and gritty, a nice vibe.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar to enjoy a quick cocktail and a salad before heading to Homestead's Carnegie Music Hall for an evening of acoustic Frampton. When we got there, there were plenty of seats both at the bar and surrounding tables. It took a while for our bartender, Lisa, to take our drink orders. She told us she was new and was just learning the ropes there, but the bar manager was overseeing the making of our drinks. Fine by us! \\n\\nAnd that's where it all went downhill. We couldn't get her attention to place our orders for dinner...repeatedly. Once the orders were taken - a beet/arugula salad with hangar steak and a wedge salad with chicken - we waited again. And waited. Again. \\n\\nAfter waiting approximately half an hour, I asked Lisa when our salads would be ready. Two women to our right gave each other looks and said to us that the kitchen is notoriously slow. I was getting nervous about making the show at this point. But we waited. Again. Another 10-15 minutes later and our salads still hadn't arrived. I asked Lisa to cancel our orders, we had to make the curtain. The tirade I endured from Lisa was inexcusable. She stood there and argued that it couldn't be cancelled, we hadn't been waiting all that long, stomped to the kitchen and came out with our salads. Freaking salads, not a Michelin starred dinner.\\n\\nI should have just paid for the drinks, but foolishly didn't want to endure any further abuse from Lisa, so just had her box up the salads and left. I have no idea how to rate the food, it's still in my fridge. We barely made it to the concert on time. \\n\\nBottom line, don't waste your time or money until the kitchen learns to make a salad in less than 45 minutes and the staff learns how to treat a customer.\",\n",

Duh. \\n\\nTiki drinks in an Asian fusion sorta kinda restaurant? Well, why not? Damned fine tiki drinks and OTHER drinks, too. My very first dabble into the G&G tiki selection was a lovely little, innocent tasting number called Jambie the Genie. Apparently inspired by Jambie in the TV screen at Pee Wee's Playhouse, what seemed mildly entertaining at first packed an evil punch of Metaxa, shochu, St. Germaine and Benedictine along with just enough guava to magically convince one there was barely any alcohol onboard. Wrong. Woo! \\n\\nOver the course of several visits (I keep going back!), I've sampled most of the written cocktail menu. (Sharing with non-germophobic friends is a great way to get to try everything without overindulging...just sayin'.) I can honestly say you can't go wrong...especially when Greta is behind the bar. Awesome barkeep! And for sure she's not the only skills behind the bar. I haven't yet tried the drinks made for a group. The Scorpion Bowl and the Porron are cocktails made to be shared when you're getting your party on with friends. (So WHY haven't we tried either of these yet?)\\n\\nBack to my habit of sampling. The Dim Sum trays that circulate the room with little dishes of delightfulness-es are another thing that bring me back again and again. Especially the Pork Belly Bites...please Mr. G&G, don't ever take these off your menu! For $5 a plate/dish you can choose as many or as few dim sum items as you wish to accompany your cocktail or as a pre(or post)-appetizer. In addition to the required pork belly, try steak or squid or scallop or chips. Chips? Not your usual chips, these are crisp-fried chicken skin pieces with a chicken liver mousse dip. Mmmmmm....\\n\\nAnd then there are the main dishes. I wish I could give you more detail here, but I keep going back to the braised short rib,broccolini,  cippolini onion, mushroom and rice noodle bowl that I can't get enough of! Bonus is that it's gluten-free - YES - G&G has GF options! Just ask. Fortunately I've also sampled a number of other dishes (thank you, friends) and haven't found anything that wasn't spot on scrumptiousness. \\n\\nDesserts? No clue. Good drinks, dim sum and an entree have always been enough for me...but they sound as fab as the rest of the menu. Then again, that gluten issue precludes many dessert choices anyway.\\n\\nAny downside? It's hard to get into. I go early...and obviously often.\",\n",

Whether one has in mind a classic tipple or one of Adam's own creations, the attention to detail is nothing short of a marvel.

For our steaks we both had the single cut fillet cooked Cajun Style which were seasoned and cooked to perfection. Absolutely the best, most tender steak I have ever eaten in my life. It was like steak flavored butter. It melted in your mouth. I added a utterly amazing crab cake to mine and she added colossal shrimp to hers. To accompany our entrees I added garlic mashed potatoes to mine and the wife added green beans to hers.\\n\\nFor dessert we shared the world famous Morton\\'s Lava Chocolate cake with ice cream.

I had tasted Savoy's food before at the Pittsburgh Magazines Best Restaurants Party multiple times and at the Yelp Tech Shop Event and at the Yelp's Soir\\xc3\\xa9e @ Savoy Elite event. Each time the food was very good.\\n\\nI saw a $49 Groupon Deal for Savoy that I couldn't pass up that included two entrees and one dessert of your choice. I decided to check them out for a date night with my wife Tamika so we could finally see what all the fuss was about. \\n\\nNow let me tell you about the space. All I can say is WOW! It is absolutely beautiful. Savoy has to be one of the most beautiful spaces in Pittsburgh. Once inside you fill like you've been transported to Atlanta, New York or Miami. It was created by Pittsburgh designer Luca Paganico and transformed an dated three story building into a posh and intimate restaurant with leather couches and chairs, a fiber optic bar, and walls with lighting that changes color as patrons dine. Upstairs in the lounge area was just as beautiful. With four separate sectional couch areas with TVs on the wall. I know it had to cost a fortune to build and furnish the space.\\n\\nWe started off with drinks. I had the Peach on Peach and the Mrs. had the Blueberry Mojito. The drinks took a while to reach the table but, once they did they were worth the wait.\\n\\nNext we enjoyed a complementary bread basket with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was very good followed by an amazing lemon sorbet to cleanse our palates.\\n\\nFor our entrees I had the N.Y. Strip Steak with compressed mushrooms, Yukon whipped potatoes and haricots verts. The streak was cooked perfectly and just how I asked for it to be cooked. My only complaint is that the sauce for the streak was extremely salty. Also like when the salt was added the top was loose and salt got dumped onto my plate. \\n\\nMy wife had the Pork Chops which was one of the dinner features that night. Her pork chops were even more salty then my steak so she only ate about a quarter of it and took the rest home. Savoy does offer quite a few Gluten Free dining options as well\\n\\nFor dessert we shared the salted carmel chocolate torte. (Roasted banana ice cream, milk chocolate cashew bark and chocolate fondue) It was even chosen as Savor Pittsburgh's Dish of the Year for 2013. IT WAS AMAZING! \\n\\nService was superb the entire evening. I also like the fact that you can make reservations right from the Savoy website which are a must as the space only seats about 75 people.\\n\\nAll in all Savoy is a nice place that I would visit for sure for drinks during Happy Hour and go somewhere else for dinner. I just cannot with a clear conscience justify the prices without a Groupon Deal.\",\n",

They were closed for remodeling due to a fire. So I walk into DiBella's and boy am I glad I did! When I walked in I noticed how clean the space was and that it had a old school feel to it.\\n\\nDiBella's not only offers subs but, salads, macaroni, potato and pasta salads, deli pickles and cookies as well. Think of Five Guy's but, with hoagies as you pick your bread, size of hoagie, cheese and toppings you want. I went up to the counter, looked over the menu and was ready to order. I went with a cheesesteak on their white bread, (similar to pretzel bread) provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, banana and sweet peppers, mayo, BBQ sauce and steak sauce. \\n\\nI got my sub toasted so the provolone could melt a little more. I added a combo of chips and a drink also. I grabbed my bag of chips, went over and filled my cup and went down to the cash register to pay. The smell of my sub being made was absolutely intoxicating! A few minutes I sat down to enjoy my hoagie. Let me tell you, it was EPIC! From the fresh bread to the tender steak to the fresh condiments, it was truly one of the best chain store subs I've ever had! It was so good that a few days later I took my wife and daughter to get a sub as well. They also have a kids menu.

For drinks we all had iced tea.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the chicken and waffles but they weren't what we expected. The chicken was defiantly over coated as you had to really work through all of the crunchy skin to get to the moist chicken. The cheddar waffles were more of a corn bread consistency with a surprise kick of Jalapeno. The saving grace was the bourbon bacon syrup. All I can say is wow! Service was just as good the second time as the first. Sarah P. was great again as she was our waitress both times.

Both of which were perfectly made with lots of fruit that went well with the rest of the drink.\\n\\nAfter a long deliberation I ordered the Carne Asada as I love beef which was outstanding! The steak was perfectly cooked and very tender. The rice went with it perfectly also. My wife had the grilled shrimp dish and our daughter loved the Cuban sandwich that she ordered as well. \\n\\nI finished off my meal with the tres leche cake. It was good but, not what I expected I guess because of all the milk that is used to make it. My wife and daughter shared the chocolate cake which they both loved.\\n\\nWhile in the neighborhood we decided to go back for another round since my wife's birthday meal was so good. We then discovered that Alma had closed and something else had opened it it's place.\\n\\nAdios Alma! You well be missed!\",\n",

They are located next to the Shamrock Inn on Western Avenue. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. \\n\\nBreakfast items include pancakes, Belgian waffles, french toast, eggs, cheese grits, bacon, sweet and hot sausage, turkey sausage, home fries and Italian, wheat or rye toast. \\n\\nLunch and dinner entrees are the same. Lunch is served from 11am to 3pm and dinner in served from 3pm to close. \\n\\nEntrees include fried chicken, fried fish, grilled or blackened Salmon, spare ribs, 9oz New York Strip, BBQ grilled chicken breast, meatloaf and blackened Tilapia. Lunch entrees come with two sides. Dinner entrees come with two sides, soup of salad and cornbread. \\n\\nSides include baked macaroni and cheese, candied yams, mashed potatoes, southern mixed greens, seasonal grilled veggies, side salad, potato salad, red beans & rice, soup, fries and sweet potato fries. \\n\\nSoups include southern fish stew, chicken & dumpling and the soup of the day. Salads offered are garden, grilled chicken, steak, blackened chicken and grilled or blackened Salmon. \\n\\nThey also offer sandwiches including burgers, clubs, grilled reubens, blackened Cajun chicken, shrimp po' boys and fried fish. They even have chicken & waffles and shrimp & grits! \\n\\nWe went on Sunday after church. As we walked to the door to enter the restaurant we were greeted by a very nice girl who must of been leaving at the end of her shift as she was wearing a black Carmi t shirt. We seated ourselves and were quickly greeted and our drink order was immediately taken. F.Y.I. The sweet tea is delicious! \\n\\nMy wife and I both ordered the Southern Fried Chicken meal which consisted of a thigh and a drumstick. For our sides we both choose the southern mixed greens (greens, cabbage and ham hock) I choose the baked mac & cheese and she got the potato salad. \\n\\nThe chicken was seasoned to perfection! The skin was crispy and crunchy, The chicken was tender and juicy! It reminds me of the chicken at Busy Bee Cafe in Atlanta. The southern mixed greens were a little spicy but still very good. The mac & cheese was amazing as well. I prefer stove cooked mac & cheese but, let me tell you, this was just as good! My wife and I really liked the potato salad as it was almost as good as her's. You get a lot of food for the money and the portion sizes are just right. \\n\\nOur daughter got the burger and fries. Big surprise! If you follow my reviews you know that she always gets that! I must say that they serve some of the best fries I have ever tasted. They are fresh cut and really, really good. She loved her burger also. \\n\\nCarmi seems to be a family business as their children, grand children? are the wait staff. I must say that it is very refreshing to see such polite, well mannered teenagers today. Service was very good and my glass never got more than half empty. \\n\\nMy only complaints are that there is no kids menu. They don't deliver and the decor is dated as others have said but, who cares?! The food is outstanding and we well be back often!\",\n",

The chips and salsa are a hit as well.\\n\\nThe next time I went I had the Carne Asada (7oz grass fed sirloin steak, agave nectar glaze, guajillo-squash puree, roasted vegetables, salsa macha and avocado) The steak was tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. \\n\\nAnother great thing about Verde is that they offer a lot of Gluten Free dining options for those looking for that option as well.\\n\\nThe true reason to go here is the tequila selection. I doubt you will find a better margarita anywhere else in the city of Pittsburgh or surrounding area for that matter.\\n\\nAll in all I love the food and drinks here and don't mind paying for them but, the prices might be a bit too high for the residents in the area.

I even got a telephone reminder from the restaurant of the date and time of our reservation. When we arrived we were greeted by the host, our jackets taken and we were escorted to our booth.\\n\\nOur waiter, John C. quickly came and took our drink orders and placed fresh warm bread on the table. Our favorite was the bread that was similar to pizza. I could eat that stuff all day long! \\n\\nF.Y.I. They do have a kid's menu but, it's not listed in the menu. You just have to ask. They offer a huge cheeseburger, chicken tenders and a kids version of just about every pasta on the menu. Our daughter got her usual cheeseburger and fries and absolutely loved them($10).\\n\\nThe wife ordered the Tagliatelle Bolognese ($15), a pasta dish with beef, pork and veal. I tried the Lasagna Fresca ($16). Each entree comes with either soup or salad. Tamika got a salad and I got the Crab Bisque. It was the best I have EVER had. I wanted to drink out of the bowl, it was that good!\\n\\nTamika thought her Bolognese was outstanding. My Lasagna was good but, not life changing. My portion was quite small compared to Tamika's huge bowl of pasta and my noodles were over cooked and almost mushy. I prefer my pasta just past al dente.\\n\\nThe service was OUTSTANDING! Tied for the best we've had in any restaurant. Our glasses never got empty. All of the waiters work as a team. If a different waiter walks by and notices a  empty plate he/she whisks it away without you even noticing it.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal we were each given a tasty ginger snap type of cookie and my wife was given a white rose which is her favorite color rose.\\n\\nMy only complaints are that my Lasagna noodles were overcooked and portion was small for the price and the kids burger is expensive @ ($10). \\n\\nI do highly recommend Donato's and will be back often.\",\n",

Once seated a server comes and takes your drinks orders and hands each of you a bowl.\\n\\n2. You go up to first station, the meat station and add as little or as much chicken, steak, pork, shrimp or imitation crab meat as you want. Ignore the \"pick one meat only \" sign. You can get all the meat available if you want. There are also lo mein and rice noodles available at the station \\n\\n3. Then you go to the vegetable station and add as much spinach, broccoli, snap peas, onions, mushrooms, water chestnuts, tomatoes, carrot and more to your bowl.\\n\\n4. Next you go to the sauce and seasonings station and pick from over twenty choices.\\n\\n5. Finally you go over to grill. You will be given a number from 1 to 10. The number you get is were you go and place your bowl and sauce(s) and wait while your food is cooked. Be sure to tip the cooks. They will give you a cheer when you do.\\n\\n6. And last but not least sit and enjoy. \\n\\nOnce you have your food your server will offer you white or brown rice, lettuce wraps or tortillas to go with your meal.\\n\\nOne bowl cost $8.99 for adults and $6.49 for kids 3 to 11, but unlimited bowls for adults are just $2 more and the second kids bowl is free. Even if you\\'re full off the first bowl go through again and take it home for lunch the next day.\\n\\nOur server Luke was great. He explained to us how everything worked. We each started off with a tasty Raspberry Lemon Aid.\\n\\nFor my first bowl I had lo mein, steak, mushrooms, onion, broccoli and yellow, red and green peppers. The cooks were really nice and talked to each person while they cooked there food. They teased us about it being our first time there.\\nLet me tell you, the food was delicious! Everything was fresh and tasted so good!\\n\\nFor my second bowl I had lo mein, chicken, shrimp, steak, mushrooms, onion, broccoli and yellow, red and green peppers. It was just as good as the first. I could only eat about a quarter of it and took the rest for lunch the next day.\\n\\nThey also offer appetizers and desserts and have a full bar.\\n\\nInsider tip: Be sure to check in using the Yelp app to get $2 off of a bowl and also to sign up for Club Mongo for future discounts and free meals.',\n",

I always wash them down with a ice cold Mexican Coca Cola. \\n\\nI still need to try the Spicy Jerk Chicken, Chicken, Bacon and Cheddar and the Juicy Pork taco.

After we had made our selections he brought us some delicious bread to start with. For beverages we all had the lemonade. It was very good and quite refreshing coming in from the summer heat.\\n\\nFor my entree I chose the 16oz Prime Ribeye Steak topped with Bacon Gorgonzola Cheese paired with a Saut\\xc3\\xa9ed Crab Cake and Lobster Macaroni and Cheese for my side. My steak was just plain remarkable! It was very tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. The Bacon Gorgonzola Cheese was the perfect addition to the steak as it added a unique flavor to the meal. The Lobster Macaroni and Cheese was exceptional as well. Full of lobster and filled with different types of cheeses. \\n\\nMy wife started off with a Caesar salad which she absolutely loved. For her entree she chose the New Orleans Mixed Grill. It features a 4 oz. Filet Mignon, grilled shrimp, Andouille sausage and roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Our daughter got the Filet Mignon topped with steak butter with garlic mashed potatoes as a side. She devoured everything on her plate so I think she was pleased.\\n\\nAfter we were finished with our meals our waiter packed the rest of our food to go and even packed us a fresh full loaf of bread to enjoy with it. he also gave us each a Eddie Merlot piece of chocolate that was delicious. \\n\\nMy only two complaints are one like others have said is that I wish the food was served a bit warmer as the AC was on Antarctica so after 15 to 20 minutes our food was getting cold and two it would have been nice to of been offered a birthday dessert or something which I wasn't which to me is strange. Otherwise our waiter has very good the entire evening. \\n\\nEddie Merlot's is a chain steak house just like Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Hype Park and Capital Grill but they defiantly bring something different and unique to the Pittsburgh Steakhouse Fine Dining Scene. \\n\\nInsider Tip: Be sure to park in the garage in the building where Eddie Merlot's is located as they will validate your parking ticket.\",\n",

Very attentive, polite and timely. The beer selection is awesome, we always order the sampler. I like having lots of options as far as beverages go. The wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time.

Thing one and thing two each had the 'small fry steaks'  with fruit (cantaloupe, melons, and grapes) and steamed broccoli and at $6.75 each, I think I was 'buffaloed' IF  you get my drift. The steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of ....

Not the best dinner they have eaten. They say you get what you pay for OR NOT!!  \\n\\nMy meal consisted of the Chicken Bacon Mac & Cheese  and at $14.75 I had no complaints. It was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon. How can anything be wrong with that much BACON!!! \\n\\nThe final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at $13.95 my mother in law was sated. Over all this meal was a wash.

       " 243: \"I have come to the belief that one thing Pittsburgh has A LOT OF is pizza joints. Some better than others. With that said there is a jewel in the crown of Pittsburgh's Northside called 'Wise guys pizza'. Their menu has a lot of great gangster names and sayings, and adds a bit of mystic to ordering for first timers. Specials like 'The Don', The GODFATHER,  'the Luca Brazzi' fish and The KINGPIN. Additionally there are phrases like; side action, and a hoagie you can't refuse. While the menu is good, it isn't the star of the show. My experience with Wiseguys is that their food is a GREAT meal for a GREAT price. Their salads A#1, their wings not too greasy, fatty, OR dry. To quote my friend Goldilocks,  these wings are JUST RIGHT. Now earlier in this review I spoke of stars. The star of Friday nights show was the cheese steak hoagie. Brimming w/meat FRESH I say again fresh vegetables, and (a pgh thing) fries. Me, and my two growing carnivores left our dinner table quite sated.  Have I eaten there before yes will I eat there again oh heck yes. They are a good bang for your buck with several specials everyday. I end my reviews with this statement and my review of Wiseguys pizza will be no different. I vote with my money and feet, and rest assured that both will be making many more trips to this eatery. If you haven't tried it. Try it. It almost makes it worth your time to move into their delivery area!!!\",\n",

My wife had the short rib hash (poached egg, horseradish hollandaise) @ around $12-14 it was priced right and tasted good.

We decided to end her birthday week celebration with another run at nirvana. We shot for the moon and ended up in the trees:(.  My wife ordered the $14.00 pub burger extra well done. The waitstaff brought it to the table with panache, and the bar was set high. When she cut the burger it was as far from well done as you could be. The burger was red and spewed blood necessitating its return to the kitchen. Upon its return the meat was still a shade of pink that prompted my wife to throw in the towel and admit defeat.

We are abandoning this restaurant.\\n\\nI don't expect this Rock Bottom to be around too much longer.  In the past, on nights when the Pirates were playing out of town, the bar and the restaurant would be packed.  Last night, it was only slightly busy.  You can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom.  The staff was overwhelmed and the bathrooms were filthy and in serious need of repairs.  Alas, I don't think that Rock Bottom will still be in business in six months.

He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak.

However, the chef did accommodate my husband's request to substitute more scallops for shrimp (he doesn't like shrimp).  My husband also tried the frog legs which he said were OK but not great.  I tried the sauce and the sauce was spicy and very tasty.  I had the filet mignon with swiss chard and squash puree.  The steak was perfectly prepared and the squash puree was creamy and delish!  I didn't eat all the greens because I'm not a big fan of swiss chard - however, the greens were appropriately prepared and not overcooked.  We also tried the butternut squash soup with crawdad tails.  I felt it was under-salted, but otherwise tasty.  Our friends really enjoyed the duck pasta and the mushroom bread pudding.  They had ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer, but it didn't appear until our meals had arrived.  Our server was gracious and had it removed from our bill.  The creme brulee is amazing and the panna cotta was outstanding!\\n\\nOne thing that impressed me the most was that the manager came over to check on us several times.  He also had a very thorough knowledge of the whiskey selection and was able to give our friend several very good alternatives to suit her palette.  The beer selection was decent if you're a hop head (which I am).  However, if you aren't into hops, you might find yourself unable to find a suitable beer.\\n\\nI asked for a table that was near the band but not too close as to preclude any conversation.  I'm happy to say that our table was close enough the music for us to enjoy it and still be able to hear our friends.\\n\\nOverall, I was incredibly impressed with Nola.  The inconsistent Yelp reviews made me squeamish about visiting, but I'm very glad that I did.  The restaurant is pricey, but the portions are decent and the food is quite good.  This is not the place to go if you have some place to be.  However, if you're in the mood for some music and a leisurely meal, I would recommend Nola.

Two large people at a small round table isn't very comfortable. We did get attitude from our server when we asked to be moved to a larger table.  But, again, the food more than made up for the bad attitude from the server.  My husband and I went there on Friday, February 13th for an anniversary dinner.  The wild mushroom risotto was amazing!  We both had the flat iron steak and it was cooked to perfection.  The charred carrot salad that the meat was served with was phenomenal.  For dessert, we had a malted chocolate potted cream that was pretty much heaven.

For our entrees, we chose the halibut and the filet mignon. My filet was perfectly prepared and came with wild mushrooms, baby carrots, and fingerling potatoes. I was surprised at how large the portion was. Normally, when you order filet in an upscale restaurant, it\\'s a 6 ounce portion but this steak was 10 ounces!  Granted, the entree is $44 bucks but the chef didn\\'t disappoint and I consider it to be worth the money. My husband\\'s halibut was a bit overcooked and dry. The manager cheerfully apologized and switched out the halibut for the Chilean sea bass over lobster couscous that was melt-in-your-mouth amazing! \\n\\nI was also very impressed with our server and her knowledge of the wines that were on the menu. She was spot on with her recommendations to pair with our meals. \\n\\nFor our dessert, we shared the Vanilla Bean pot de creme and were glad we did because that dessert was HUGE. It came with a blackberry sorbet and a raspberry gastrique. The sorbet was light and not overly sweet and the gastric was a great accompaniment to the richness of the creme. A cute little touch from the chef was \"Happy Anniversary\" written across the top of the dish. \\n\\nFinally, the chef sent little bags of house-made cookies to go home with us. The view, by the way, is amazing! One caveat about Altius - it\\'s expensive. Dinner for two with dessert (on the house because it was our anniversary) was $210 with tip. However, if you need a splurge and a reason to dress up and be pampered, Altius is the place to go.  We will definitely be back!',\n",
       " 254: \"I'm very disappointed to say this place has gone down hill. While my boyfriend and I use to really enjoy coming here, the food has gotten considerably worse. They've taken many things off the menu we use to enjoy, such as the pretzel sticks with beer cheese, and replaced them with frozen ballpark pretzels and nacho cheese. Tonight I ordered a steak salad, of which the steak was good, but there was nothing on the salad that was listed on the menu. Not to mention the whole place smells smells like dirty mop water. The beer is still very good, that's why still gave them 2 stars.\",\n",
       " 255: \"The experience was different the second time around. We asked for a booth and got one right away. When we sat down, the waitress came fast and serve our drinks and appetizers fast. The food was great until the steak and shrimp came with the broccoli. It was not good, the broccoli was burnt bad and I ask medium well and they sent it bloody. My boyfriend's bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back. They sent the burnt broccoli back and I got a great salad, the steak had to go all the way to well done, but I believe the grill is not being clean properly cause the steak tasted burnt and charred. So the manager came over and ask my boyfriend if he wanted something else, he didn't and he asked me how he could make it better, I asked that next time could we have are food done properly cooked. He apologized and actually looked out with discounting the meal and gave us fresh spinach dip, which I enjoyed. I will not return but the customer service was awesome and I won't say don't go, but know what to order and what to watch out for when ordering!\",\n",

We arrived a few minutes early, but they were able to seat us when we got there.  \\n\\nThe beer is consistently good here--  I went with the fire chief red ale, and my husband tried both one of the cask strength beers and an IPA.  I ordered the bacon chicken mac n' cheese, and it was as good as I remembered.  My husband's steak was overdone, but the servers were very apologetic (they offered to replace it, and ended up comping it) and he said it was seasoned well.  For dessert, we split the mason jar bourbon pecan pie, and it was delicious, with a really delicious ice cream on top.\\n\\nThis location may not have quite lived up to our expectations from the original, but I'd be happy to end up here again if I'm in the area.\",\n",

They had a decent selection of beer (although we were uncreative and went with Yuengling) that was nice and cold and reasonably priced given the location.

The dressing was tasty, the roasted peppers were a good addition, and the chicken was well-cooked.  I was expecting it to be a little more like a pasta salad based on the description, but I ended up really liking it.  Plus, the croissant it came with was absolutely amazing.  My parents split the chicken ciabatta sandwich and said it was great.  They also both got a cup of the clam chowder and liked it, but said it wasn't fantastic.  My friend got a reuben and enjoyed it, but loved the potato soup.  They had a decent beer selection and were great with water and other drink refills.\\n\\nI'd definitely go back.

On my last visit for lunch I had the mole enchiladas, and they were excellent-- maybe not the best mole I've ever had, but heaven for this Mexican-food-starved-Seattleite.  They make the guacamole tableside and can make it as spicy as you want, which is nice.  Their chips are good as are both salsas, although I didn't really detect a difference in heat.

My rozmopolitan cocktail was to die for, and they made my husband a great drink as well.  The smoked salmon appetizer was delicious-- the potato blinis were the perfect vehicle for the salmon, and the horseradish creme wasn't overpowering.  For entrees, I had the four herb fettucine with steak and loved it.  The noodles were definitely closer to linguine than fettucine, but the sauce was light and delicious and the beef filet pieces were grilled very well.  My husband had the filet and said it was excellent; the fries that came with had a great balsamic sauce on top and the onion rings were a delicious bonus.\\n\\nOur second dinner was less exciting, but still very good.  We both had steaks; my sirloin was cooked perfectly at medium, but his ended up more medium well than medium rare, which was very unfortunate.\\n\\nThe breakfast is a standard Scottish breakfast, but everything is done very well.  The eggs are fresh, the sausage is great, and there's a wide selection of fruit.\\n\\nService is great at both mealtimes, and the vibe is classy without being stuffy.\\n\\nI'd highly recommend Tempus, especially if you are staying at the George.\",\n",

I'm a sucker for anything with bubbles, and the orange pomegranate champagne cocktail definitely delivered.  I'm not a fan of tonic, but apparently the G&T with house-made tonic is great.  The beer and wine options were very good as well.

We had:\\n--beef jerky: I typically don't even like beef jerky, but this was really, really good.  \\n--Scotch egg: I skipped this one, but my husband said it was delicious.\\n--roasted squash soup: one of the best soups I've had in a long time-- just the right amount of sweetness and a good mix of spice as well.\\n--steak frites: I tried a bite, and this was great.  Grilled perfectly to medium rare, and the fries were super crispy.\\n--shepherd's pie: simple, but delicious.  The gravy was rich and flavorful, and per usual in Pittsburgh, the potatoes were on point.\\n--dessert: I can't remember what my other half ordered, but the dark chocolate souffle cake was amazing.

       " 262: 'I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \"The Hangover\" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I\\'ve seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It\\'s spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you\\'ll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob\\'s long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don\\'t remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie\\'s I\\'ve been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I\\'m being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It\\'s probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn\\'t that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you\\'re more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.',\n",
       " 263: 'There is nothing really to complain about here.  This Mortons is like most in other cities.  It\\'s definitely for the expense account crowd.  It\\'s fun to go to a place and to know exactly what you are in for.  I\\'ve been to Mortons all over the country and this one stacks up pretty well.  It\\'s like most other high end chain steakhouses (Palm, Ruth\\'s, Capital Grille, etc.).  The bar is pretty lame, but I\\'m guessing most go here for a sit down dinner.  Capital Grille or Hyde Park bar is much better for bar scene.  But, one thing I definitely appreciate about the bar is  the bar menu.  If you\\'ve never been to Mortons and you are watching your budget go to the bar have a cold beer and order the PRIME cheeseburger trio or the Filet sandwiches for only 6 DOLLARS.  Plus, the fries are awesome.  The dining room is really nice with dark wood and lots of leather.  The service is awesome because I\\'m guessing you have to be pretty good to land a server position that might end up paying you 6 figures.  The food is great.  However, my opinion is that most true high end steakhouses all have similiar quality steak.  I eat here a few times a year and my favorite first courses are the lobster bisque (Very good, but not as good as capital grille) and the tuna tartare.  Stay away from the filet.  I mean it\\'s tender and delicious, but try a steak with a little flavor.  I\\'m guessing if you\\'re like me you don\\'t go to Mortons often, so try something that  is hard to get elsewhere.  Get the Cajun ribeye.  I can\\'t remember if Pittsburgh location does a bone in ribeye, but if they do I would say a cajun bone in ribeye will be one of the best if not the best steaks you ever try.  I also suggest getting the \"lazy\" lobster.  There are few things in life more indulgent or enjoyable than having a two pound lobster cooked perfectly already cracked for you.  It\\'s pure indulgence.  The asparagus is great and as big as a baseball bat.  The spinach is great and the hash browns are a must have.  You should definitely save room for desert and there is no better desert here than the chocolate souffle\\'.  Remember to tell them that is what you want for desert when you order your entrees.  I wish the bar was better, because if it was I\\'d go here more often.  This place is exactly what you would expect.  And, that\\'s a good thing.',\n",
       " 264: \"The steaks here are very good.  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.  Overall a very fine experience.  I'd rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners Mortons, Capital Grille,  Ruth Chris, Hyde Park.  And, for bar area and bar dining Capital Grille, Hyde Park, Mortons, Ruth Chris.\",\n",
       " 265: \"Oh Sammy's...how glad I am to reconnect. I had first sampled the famous about five years ago and hadn't had one since.  Now, that I've moved the office downtown it's convenient for me to visit as much as I'd like.  Ray, Tom and I found ourselves wondering around the city around lunchtime trying to get a lay of the land and find the good lunch spots when we spotted Sammy's... I had almost forgot about this place.  There are a few locations around the city with two downtown (I think?).  The one we went to is close to 6th St. I think.  You walk in and it looks like anyother dumpy yinzer bar with a poke machine to the left next to the cigarette vending.  There is a large bar in the center of the restaurant with plenty of regulars having a lunch beer. It's relatively dark inside and for somereason really muggy, not sure why because it's relatively cool outside.  There also is a few larger tables on the right where we decide to sit.  At first we all sat down thinking that there was a server, there wasn't.  So, we looked a little dumb (not the first time), then we realized that you actually order and pay yourself in the back.  In the back there is a deli counter with large coolers to also purchase beer by the 6 pack (I guess).  I order for Ray and myself.  I get one corned beef on rye with swiss and a side of dark mustard.  I also get another corned beef with cole slaw as the topping for us. Tom gets the corned beef with cole slaw ontop.  I also order a couple orders of macaroni salad and grab a couple of iced teas out of the cooler.  We walk back to the table and I first sample the macaroni salad, not good...not good at all...The flavor is somewhat offputting and there also is something sweet like cinammon in it.  I only have a bite.  Now, the sandwiches are great!  I had a 1/2 of the Corned Beef on rye wiht mustard and it's great!  The bread is fresh, the mustard is cgood quality and the corned beef is delicious piled high packed with flavor.  The other 1/2 I tried with the coleslaw on top is also delicious the coleslaw is creamy and is the perfect topping for the savory corned beef.  I'm glad I re-discovered this place and the next time I'll just get a sandwich to go.\",\n",

After a very long night I woke up in my hotel room feeling the effects of the previous night.  Had a friend in from Delaware and he actually suggested we go after seeing it featured on the food network.  We were there before they opened and actually waited for them to unlock the doors.  I had a gourmet burger cooked perfectly.  The meat had a ton of flavor and it was grilled perfectly.  The  hash browns were a nice change than fries and the coleslaw actually tasted great and wasn\\'t just a \"throw away\" side.  My friend chose a burger with no cheese or condiments just to savor the burger in it\\'s pure form.  True to the hype my friend declared what I\\'m sure has been spoken many times that this is the \"best burger he\\'s ever had\".',\n",

However, if you have an expense account or are a guest of someone with an expense account (as I was last night) than this is a good option.  In fact, this is the best sushi I\\'ve had in Pittsburgh.  Umi is a part of the admirable big  burrito group.  It\\'s located above Soba.  It\\'s up two long sets of stairs, so if you are bringing someone handicapable or elderly they\\'ll have trouble navigating the double staircases.  As I was walking up the stairs last night I noticed the painted large waves on the walls.  I believe Umi is japanese for big wave (maybe?).  Our reservation was for 6:30 and initially they only had the tatami tables where you sit on the ground and your feet dangle in a hole in the floor.  These tables are probably okay for date night, but would have been weird with two business associates.  Luckily, a table opened up.  If it\\'s this busy on a Tuesday I suggest a reservations.  Anyways, the rest of the space is very nice with a sushi bar with about 5 seats as soon as you enter and very warm colors with a few scuptures and a waterfall in the middle of the dining room.  The service was pretty good.  There was nothing particularly memorable.  I started with a Mark West Chardonnay, which was okay and priced under $10.  They also have a good selection of warm and cold sake\\'.  I started with the white tuna sashimi which was a few slices of super fresh melt in your mouth tuna with a nice soy sauce and just the right amount of wasabi.  Matt tried the shrimp tempura which was perfectly breaded quickly fried light shrimp with veggies.  This was a good deal at $12.  Keith had the lobster soup which had a few big chunks of lobster and a nice broth.  I ordered the toro tartar with caviar, which was probably a teaspoon of super creamy fatty tuna and a touch of caviar.  This was really rich and one of the most expensive teaspoon serving I\\'ve ever had at $21 for such a small amount.  Keith had some noodle dish which he said was good and actually was pretty reasonable, but again it\\'s noodles.  Matt ordered the strip steak tataki, which was about 1 1/2 ounces of prime steak served with a sweet soy sauce.  It was delicious, but again $20 for less than a 2 oz. serving.  I stuck with sashimi.  The lobster sashimi was great and had some type of flavored sauce instead of just soy.  The salmon and tuna were also amazing.  They were cut perfectly and tasted like they were just pulled from the sea.  Overall a really good sashimi \"dinner\", however I have to admit I did stop for pizza a few hours later.',\n",

I\\'ve already admitted it\\'s nothing special.  I know you\\'ve been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he\\'s about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers\\'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what\\'s so bad is it was right in front of us.

The space is gorgeous, high ceilings, organ, pipes, stained glass, etc.  This place has outdoor seating, however I always seem to forget.  It has delicious brick oven pizza, with fresh sauce, and perfectly cooked cheese.  I only wish their crust was thinner.  The wine selection sucks, but the spirits offered are pretty ample.  They won\\'t offer samples of the cask conditioned, which is okay because all there beer is pretty good and they offer samples of all the rest.  The stout was below average.  I had their \"kobe\" steak sandwich, for $11,,, really?? \"kobe\"?? Either way, perfecty acceptable sandwich and the sweet potato fries are a nice touch.  Friend had the salmon, she said it was delicious and cooked perfectly.  We tried the brie, which was about c level brie with nice breading and figs (nice touch!), the non-traditional perogies were no good, overcooked, overpriced and underflavored.  The service was better than most.

       " 270: \"This is my favorite divey type bar in the south side.  I have been going here for at least 10 years and it's nice to go to a place and know exactly what you're gonna get.  This place is usually the last stop of a long night.  I found myself there last night once again closing the place out, which unfortunately due to my advancing age and mellowing tempermant I find myself doing less and less frequently, thus the impetus for me to document this fine establishment.  It's located on E. Carson St. next to the parking lot by the Pittsburgh Steak Company.  It's plenty big and most folks spend their time located at the long bar to the left after you enter.  In the back there is a pool table and a bunch of booth seating.  It's really a shame because this is a lot of wasted space for an E. Carson St. location.  They also have a fully operational kitchen in the back but don't expect a menu.  They may have served food long long ago, but do not now.  They did attempt to revive their kitchen about a year ago, but it didn't work out.  You'll mostly be snacking on bags of chips, crackers and beef jerky unless you luck out and Cindy is behind the bar and is willing to make you a burger on the small grill behind the bar.  If she is making burgers you should order one they are surprisingly good, either that or I'm usually tipsy enough to appreciate anything warm when I'm here.  All of there bartenders, cindy, billy, etc. are all great and have been there for years.  This is definitely a last stop destination and usually never super crowded.  The folks are a pretty wide mix, but after midnight mostly mid 20 somethings and 30 somethings with a few local older yinzers mixed in.  They have a couple of tv's (no plasmas) and you could do a lot worse than to watch the game here.  In fact during the last steelers superbowl run I found myself here often.  Also, the free ham bbq's aren't bad either.  This is not a place to order wine, but they do have a good beer selection including guiness on draught and a few imports.  They make a strong drink with most top shelf liquors available and the prices are cheap.  Again, this is a great place to end the night and often closing time is on their own schedule.\",\n",
       " 271: 'I went here last weekend for a late lunch/early dinner type thing.  It was about 430 PM on Saturday and I was visiting my friend Rob\\'s and he has told me for a long time his favorite spot for sushi is Kiku.  I had been in the past, but not since I really developed a palate for sushi.  Anyways, I really didn\\'t want to like this place initially because of its tourist trap location of Station Square across the way from hard rock cafe, hooters and the like.  I was wrong to judge so quickly.  This restaurant basically brought sushi to pittsburgh 25 years ago and I guess they shouldn\\'t be judged for a housing decision made long ago when places like hooters didn\\'t even exist (a glorious time indeed).  You step into this restaurant and its like stepping into a different atmosphere completely.  You are away from the obnoxious interrogation mall lights into a dimly lit soothing atmosphere.  I think the only sound you here is water running from somewhere and the restaurant is intimate while still being private.  There is a small bar and dining room to the immediate left and further in the back there is a sushi bar manned by gents\\' who look like actual sushi chefs and I was told by one of the staff have over 75 years experience combined between the three.  We sit in the front dining/bar area.  The place is pretty empty due to the early hour, but this is good because it gives us pretty much free reign for Rob and Olga\\'s boy Alex.  The server comes over promptly. She\\'s a young japanese girl with a big and corteous smile.  She offers warm rags and asks if she can bring anything for the boy while we decide.  We start with the sushi lovers platter for two and share it between the three of us.  It\\'s not cheap at about $48.  However, the sushi is quite good.  The rice cooked perfectly with just the right amount of wasabi.  The fish very fresh and sliced well.  They even offer toro on this sampler.  All in all very good sushi, but certainly not the best in Pittsburgh.  I\\'d say right now the best sushi in Pittsburgh is Umi (you\\'ll pay for it though).  Next the waitress brings some miso soup which is good, but unmemorable.  I was a bit surprised to see they had only one or two choices for sake and almost no wine list to speak of.  We tried some good cold sake.  It was fine, but quite expensive.  I think around $30/bottle for three small pours total.  Rob and I had one each.  Next we tried the \"shobu shobu\".  This is a fondue type way of eating in which they bring over a steaming pot of savory broth along with a side of sliced steak, noodles, tofu, veggies etc. and diners get to cook their own food.  It\\'s a fun way to eat when you are with some other folks on a personal night out.  It\\'d be good for date night or friends, but I think a little off if it were for a business meeting.  The food itself is fine.  I mean the meat is okay quality the veggies seem fresh and its fun to cook yourself, but probably not a gourmet dining experience.  The cost is $21 per person (minimum of 2 people) fo this dish.  This place deserves kudos for bringing sushi to pittsburgh. It has good sushi and seemingly other good traditional japanese dishes.  My biggest pet peeve with this place is that the cost seems out of line with the location and food.  I didn\\'t pay, but I bet Rob didn\\'t get out of there for less than $200 and we really didn\\'t even drink.  If you find yourself in Station Square you could do a lot worse than this place and you should go here since its a local business and not the mega mcfunsters that seem to invaded this once fun spot.',\n",
       " 272: 'This is a good spot and a good choice for the big burrito chain.  I was here last night and the place was pretty busy.  The decor is totally tacky, but in a fun way.  It\\'s a relatively small restaurant with a really big bar.  There\\'s also outdoor seating, which is great for people watching in the strip.  The service was friendly and prompt without being intrusive.  The bathrooms are a little out of the way in the basement, but nevertheless nice and much nicer than I remember them years ago.  We started with a selection of appetizers.  The black bean dip with cheese was pretty good and is the same stuff you get at mad mex.  The scallopp app\\' was awesome, three huge scallops perfectly cooked with a nice sauce.  I got the \"pork belly\".  I\\'ve had this in other places and it was different than this.  This was basically a really fatty barbecued rib, but I like ribs,so I was happpy enough.  My entree\\' was the flank steak, which was a nice portion but a little undercooked and the black bean side was cold.  Overall an average entree\\'.  My friend ordered the shrimp with curry vegetables, which she liked a lot and had plenty of leftovers.  I tried the shrimp and they were cooked well and very fresh.  The curry veggies were super hot.  I was a bit disappointed in the wine list having asked for two of the wines on the menu only to find out that they were out of stock.  This is a good spot, but I wouldn\\'t really consider it caribbean or west indian food.  I\\'m from the carribbean, so maybe I have too high standards.  I\\'d say this is to carribean food what olive garden is to italian food.',\n",
       " 273: 'I really like this place, sure it\\'s busy and you\\'ll have to wait for a table but it\\'s totally worth it.  I first visited this place about a decade ago when it was a much smaller place and not as well known, but they\\'ve always paid special attention to the food and beer selection.  I was here yesterday with a larger group of friends and we had a blast.  We didn\\'t have a reservation and there was about 8 of us, so the wait was about 45 minutes.  Great excuse to have a few belgian beers prior to lunch.  We ordered some fries with bacon and cheese and also some fried mushrooms as appetizers, greasy goodness!!  The server was really good, she definitely knew what she was talking about with respect to beer selection and was very generous in offering samples of different delicious beers.  She was friendly, knowledgeable and then had a beer with us after her shift was over.  The wings are a must have when you visit.  My favorite item on the menu is the chargrilled wings which are delicious.  They are baked and then grilled, so they are not greasy at all and are actually probably relatively healthy for you... relatively...  The garlic parm wings are also great and I suggest you definitely try these as well.  I also ordered the steak and egg \"headwich\" which is  definitely as big as my head.  It was enough for three of us to share along with the wings.  And, to top it all off as if 6 belgian beers, wings, steaks, and eggs weren\\'t enough we also tried one of the desserts (cheesecake) which was a little better than average.  Overall, this place has one of the best beer selections in town and probably the best bar food in the burgh\\'.  It\\'s a must visit when you are in the city.',\n",
       " 274: \"I used to go here all the time when I lived in the city, now I only make it a couple fo times a month.  Dean and Richie (owners) are total pittsburgh originals.  You have to have the right expectations with this place.  The steaks are not as good as capital grille, mortons, etc.. But, they are very reasonably priced and are good.. not great...but good.  I suggest you just have a cheesburgher or try the filet/portabella appetizer (which used to be the best deal in town at 8.95, however now I think it's like $13).  My buddy Dan is the bartender and he's been doing it since he was 18 about 1/2 his life so he knows what he's doing you'll have fine conversation if you go alone and end up talking to the bartender all night.  The other bartender is good too.. Josh.\",\n",
       " 275: 'I stopped in this place yesterday on a rainy Saturday afternoon with Matt and Rob.  I always forget about this place, which is a shame because it\\'s worth a visit especially to find a decent bar with good plasmas\\' and always a seat at the bar.  It\\'s located across from Starbucks on E. Carson St.  It\\'s a converted bank that has tall ceilings, private room downstairs and plenty of seating and a marble bar on the main floor.  The vault still exists in this converted bank, however now it\\'s a handicapped restroom.  The regular restrooms are in the basement, which is a bit inconvenient.  The restrooms only had the hot air machines and no papertowels.  I don\\'t know anyone who prefers this option.  I started with the chili.  THe bartender, Brian said he made it himself.  It was very good with lots of flavor, fresh seasonings, big chunks of beef and well cooked kidney beans.  My only complaint is that it was served only luke warm.  I also ordered the steak quesadilla.  It was a healthy portion of only mildly flavorful steak umm type meat and plenty of cheese.  It was a little below average, but it\\'s not like I\\'m at an authentic tex mex place.  Rob ordered the \"Fried Bologna\" sandwich, which I give kudos to this place for just having such an item on the menu.  I tried it and was pretty impressed.  It was my first fried bologna sandwich.  They served it with a fried egg and a few juicy slices of tomatoes.  Matt ordered the chicken fingers and fries.  The chicken fingers were what you\\'d expect, but the fries were well above average I\\'d guess cut fresh daily and double fried.  My favorite aspect of my time spent here yesterday was one of the better top shelf long island iced teas I\\'ve had in this city.  Brian is a true pro and made a strong and delicious cocktail.  The prices are fair here and if you are looking for an alternative to the 45 min. typical wait that you\\'ll have at Fatheads you could do a lot worse than this place.',\n",
       " 276: 'I had dinner here last night and I can\\'t claim to have as strong feelings as some of my fellow \"yelpers\".  I arrived around 8 PM after the extra innings of the Pirates game and the north shore bar crawl.  I\\'m guessing my palate was dulled a bit by a day of eating nachos, hot dogs and drinking cheap beer.  I\\'d say the best thing about this place is the bar scene (which is on par if not a little better than Capital Grille) and my favorite thing about this place is the pretzel bread (which is awesome with lots of butter). That\\'s right the best thing about this supposed high end steakhouse is pretzel bread.  That\\'s it...  That\\'s my review..... Okay, a few other comments.  The bar service has always been pretty good, but not exceptional.  If it was better than average I\\'d guess that I would know a few of the bartenders.  The waitress was fine and the drinks are appropriately \"stiff\".  The lobster bisque was not too impressive.  My favorite steak place lobster bisque is the capital grille by far.   I ordered a filet with bernaisse sauce.  It was okay.  I\\'m guessing a prime cut, but definitely not aged like a steak at Mortons or Capital Grille.  It was cooked well.   The bernaise lacked flavor which is important when eating such a dull piece of meat.  The sides were good.  We had the asparagus and spinach.  Both were cooked and seasoned well.  A friend ordered the lamb chops which were good and a better choice than my filet.  I have to admit I\\'ve enjoyed steaks at \"The Outback\" more than I did with this place.  This restaurant tries to be a Mortons, Ruths and the like.  But, it\\'s really just a bit of an overpriced TGIF.  It\\'s not in the same league as a fine dining restaurant, which is unfortunate because there is room for more fine dining in Pittsburgh.  Again, it\\'s not bad but I suggest that their is space for places like \"The Outback\" and \"Mortons\", but a space should not exist for something in between.  I suggest the best steak chain place right now is Capital Grille for quality of food and fun bar.',\n",
       " 277: 'I\\'ve decided to write an update and add a star to this place after my experience last night.  I was there for a business dinner with a bunch of folks who encouraged me to add a star and mention each by name, so here I am.  This is a chain restaurant, but a relatively small chain with locations primarily in OH, PA and now FL.  They attempt to compete with the high end steakhouses (Ruths, Palm, Mortons, Capital Grille) and up until last night I felt they were mostly out of their league.  However, my opinion has changed.  We arrived last night at about 6:30 PM.  They have a great circular bar with a few hightops and a deep relaxing red tone to the whole place.  Their wine selection is displayed in the front near a few areas for lounging.  They have a couple of fireplaces and it\\'s a white tablecloth type of dining scene with multiple private rooms.  It\\'s a relatively large restaurant and they also offer valet parking.  In terms of atmosphere it may be my favorite.  The feel is a little different than capital grille which feels \"clubby\".  This place has a less formal or younger feel.  Keith organized us all together and we started with good cocktails at the bar I had a nice ketel dirty rocks martini with blue cheese olives that was served by a very nice and professional bar matron.  We ordered a bunch of things, so I hope to remember them all.  I ordered raw oysters which were served fresh, cold with a nice tasting cocktail sauce.  Tom had the seared ahi, which was good quality tuna coated slightly with sesame seeds and served with a wasabi and siracha sauce.  I think Keith and Lloyd ordered the calamari which was great!  If you can only order one appetizer here get the calamari.  It\\'s lightly breaded served with a sweet and hot light sauce.  The only calamari slightly better in the city is my buddy Ron\\'s at Pangea.  I can\\'t quite recall if we ordered any other apps\\'.  I chose the lobster bisque instead of a salad and I was hoping it was better than the last time I ordered.  It wasn\\'t.  This bisque was my only real disappointment of the night.  It was too think and the lobster was unnoticeable.  Jim, Matt and Pat all ordered the iceberg wedge which was huge and looked really good.  It\\'s your standard half a head of lettuce served with blue cheese and bacon I believe.  I was really impressed with the entrees\\' and sides.  They tailor a portion of the menu to reflect a sports theme.  They also serve plenty of steaks bone in which is much more flavorful.  I had the 22 oz. Santonio Holmes bone in Ribeye medium rare.  It was delicious and as good as any steak I\\'ve ever had.  The beef was prime, cooked perfectly on an 1800\\' grille and served pipin hot.  I didn\\'t care for the teeny onion rings on the side but they were easy enough to push away.  Most of us ordered these and were all impressed.  Keith had the bone in strip which also looked really good.  The sides were perfect.  The asparagus was huge and the hollaindaise was not coagulated.  The mushrooms were cooked well and the mashed potatoes were creamy and rich.  There were a few desserts ordered.  I sampled the carrot cake and it was great.  It was easily big enough for three.  I mostly drank the house shiraz all night which was fine and I\\'m guessing less than $10 a glass.  Overall this place has really picked up it\\'s game and in my opinion can finally compete in the high end steakhouse arena.',\n",
       " 278: 'I really had fun at this place.  The bar scene is decent and the crowds are younger and typically enjoying themselves too much (like me).  I\\'ve been here a few times and meant to write a review.  The last time I went I was with a friend of mine who is a school teacher in Vegas and she was really blown away.  This place definitely is not the kind of place you  go with a teachers salary.  I had intially tried to get a reservation and was told none were available.  I then talked to one of the casino hosts who a friend hooked me up with (Jesse... young asian guy).  And, magically we had a prime table at 8 PM.  You should dress to impress and plan on dancing the food off after dinner.  We went with another couple.. none of my friends had been there before and defaulted to steaks.  Becky had a filet (I think.. had a few drinks by dinner time).  It was cooked perfectly and was definitely a prime cut.  I tried it and while it was tender and moist I think in general Filet\\'s lack flavor.  Mike had a bone in ribeye which  was  awesome and probably one of the best tasting steaks I\\'ve ever tried.  I don\\'t remember what his wife had.  Since I\\'ve tried the steaks before and quite frankly in my opinion steaks at the high end steak places all pretty much taste the same to me whether its mortons, ruths, capital grille etc.. I think they differentiate themselves with atmosphere, service, and the sides.  I had a lobster that they cracked for me.  It was ridicoulous.  I think it was like 3 lbs. and I would suggest if you are going to try this you should ask the price first.  I\\'m pretty sure this lobster was around $150.  It was good, cooked perfectly and lots of butter.  The sides were pretty good, but nothing remarkable.  We had the mashed potatoes.  I think there was lobster in it (but not much).  For some reason I\\'m pretty sure they didn\\'t have asparagus, which was disappointing.  Overall a fun experience, great service, good atmosphere, and I definitely suggest hitting the \"Ghost Bar:\" next door.',\n",
       " 279: 'Has it really been almost a month since I\\'ve reviewed a restaurant in Pittsburgh?? Well, for shame Neal M. let me remedy this directly and I couldn\\'t have picked a much better spot than Bistro 19 to begin my spring reviews.  I was here for dinner on Tuesday of last week with a couple business associates.  I arrived a little after 7 PM to meet Tom and Mike who were seated at the bar enjoying their first cocktail.  The space itself is quite nice and intimate.  However, they seem to use the space well as to make it seem much larger than it\\'s actual I\\'d guess 1,000 - 1,500 sq. ft dimension.  You enter and are greated by a large bar typcially packed with locals in casual wear and suits alike,  The interior is sparce and minimalist with high ornate ceilings and tables located throughout but not so close as to lack privacy.  The colors are dark deep browns, gold and green.  The tile columns and exposed wine rack are also a nice touch.  The bathroom is located in the back near the kitchen entrance and are large and well designed.  After a cocktail at the bar we make our way to a table in the back with a nice view of the bustling suburban street on a spring weekday.  The server greets us promptly with a big smile and reviews the features while grabbing us all another cocktail.  I\\'m having dirty martini rocks which are pretty good, however lacking those really big olives that I likeand most often get at steakhouses.  The meal starts with some bread and butter, meh.. then we order a couple of appetizers.  Mike says he really likes the \"pot stickers\", so we try those and then also try the lemon pepper calamari.  The calamari is fine served very lightly breaded with some type of mayo sauce or remoulade.  The pot stickers are also adequate spiced with some type of thai sauce.  We all decide on salads instead of soups and I try the french onion soup, which was very good.  It had a much more layered flavor than many other french onion soups you get in casual spots and was well seasoned with a somehow still crunchy croute and mounds of gruyare.  Tom and Mike tried the soup of the day which was some type of chicken thai soup that also tasted pretty good from the small sampling I had.  It is so true that you can tell a lot about a chef by their soups and this start led me to believe the rest of the meal wouldn\\'t let us down.  Tom and Mike had the chilean sea bass, which was a nice healthy serving of perfectly cooked sweet sea bass with a nice slaw and marinade.  I had the \"steak and cake\" which was their filet (good quality, not prime) cooked perfectly medium rare along with large perfectly cooked asparagus, mashed potatoes (forgettable) and a good crabcake.  The crabcake had almost no filler and was served with a nice mustard sauce.  This crabcake is good and almost in the same league as Andora\\'s or monterey bay\\'s crabcake,,, almost...  We finished by splitting their version of \"bananas foster\",,, it was very good with a flaky crust and homemade whipped cream I\\'d guess.  Overall this is a very good option with a warm atmosphere and good prospects in my estimation for long term success in this casual fine dining segment.',\n",
       " 280: 'I am very much over \"Tusca\".  I first visited here over a year ago and have been here aboout a dozen times since and I\\'ve never had  a good experience.  The only reason I go here is because it is convenient and they have outdoor seating. Yesterday\\'s experience was the impetus to finally document and update my distaste for this place.  We get there about 130 PM prior to going to seeing the new mike judge movie. We enter and head towards the bar.  It is very muggy inside of this place, how they manage that I just don\\'t know.  It\\'s a relatively mild humidity day outside and feels like a costa rican airport inside.  There also is an off putting smell to the place that is a cross between some kind of industrial cleaner and something else I can\\'t quite place..maybe the smell of broken dreams...  The bartender is so obviously uninterested and apathetic that you can feel the contempt he obviously has for the customers and the disappointment in where he finds himself.  I ask for a guinness and they don\\'t have one nor do they suggest a suitable alternative.  Annie gets a pretty awful vodka/tonic and I settle on a shiraz,,,maybe the worst glass of wine I\\'ve ever had in a restaurant.  It was just gross.  Annie orders a pizza, which truthfully was edible.  I mean it was cheese, marinara and soggy crust.  I had the hot tapas steak and fries,,,which took close to an hour to receive with no apology.  The steak was okay, the fries were edible, but again I was so turned off by the atmosphere that even if the food was really good, which it wasn\\'t I wouldn\\'t be back.',\n",
       " 281: 'It was a warm early summer night and Annie surprised me with reservations for this charming little bistro that I have been meaning to visit since it\\'s opening, but for whatever reason just kept missing the opportunity.  However, after chatting with the chef at the restaurant party I\\'d renewed my urgency for visiting.  The restaurant is located on s. braddock ave. in regent square.  I used to spend more time here back when a friend lived near and its added a few good spots since (D\\'s six pags and dogz for example, but I\\'ll save that review for another time).  This is a nice area for date night with a few places for casual fine dining, independant flick at Regent square theater or shopping then pool and guiness at one of the local irish pubs.  Legume offers outdoor dining which is great especially when their is good people watching like there is here.  We weren\\'t able to sit outside, but got a fine table in the intimate and dimly lit dining room.  It is a small place and unfortunately we were seated a little too close to some guy going on and on about \"hedge funds\", so it was a little too close for comfort.  I think there is like 8 or 10 tables mostly 4 tops.  The floors are hardwood and I like some of the details of the space itself such as the fixtures and art.  These folks also get the details as I noticed with the silverware they were using (I think \"Toast!\" uses the same type of simple ornate silverware).  A couple other non food details... It\\'s byob for a small corkage fee of $3.  Many other spots charge $10.  You can feel comfy in Jeans, flip flops, or a suit and I noticed all forms of attire and all ages.  These folks are totally ingredient driven and I\\'m sure are into the whole farm to table movement and sustainability.  They change most of the menu daily and use top quality ingredients and often serve traditional fare with a contemporary flair.  Okay, onto the food.  We started with some good quality crusty bread and delicious room temperature high quality butter.  Our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive.  I started with the tuna tartar. It was a nice portion of sushi grade tuna with perhaps a citrus or some type of acid used to cut the richness of the fish.  It was okay, I mean it didn\\'t blow me away, but was perfectly acceptable.  However, I have to admit I\\'ve had tuna tartare that seemed to have a more crisp or \"bright\" flavor if you will at other places.  Again, it was fine just not 5 stars.  Annie tried the Buttermilk soup with bulger, chickpeas and parsley.  Unfortunately, Annie didn\\'t know it was served cold and that would have been a non starter for her before go.  I tasted it and not really being a fan of cold soup it wasn\\'t my thing either.  I get what he was going for I think.  It was rich while also not seeming to be too heavy.  It had a very layered flavor and I noticed many different spices most notably curry.  I had the steak for my entree and I think it was served with mashed potatoes.  It was cooked perfectly, delicious and flavorful.  The mashed potatoes were also really good. I don\\'t think I want to know how much cream and butter is used.  For me the steak was the first thing I had that I really liked here.  Annie had their famous \"Chicken cooked under a skillet with garlic and mashed potatoes\".  I really enjoyed this also and see why it is so popular.  The chicken was moist and I prefer this than to just boring chicken breast.  The skin was great and the mashed potatoes again were quite good.  We skipped dessert, however I think next time we\\'ll definitely try them.  One last thing the waitress noticed Annie didn\\'t eat her soup and insisted on taking it off the bill.  This place is quite good and probably deserves 3.5 stars.  I hope to do a better job on my choices next time and update this review with another star.',\n",
       " 282: \"Underwhelmed, yes I'd say this word sums up my experience.  However, I will expand.  We were here last night for dinner and I was a bit disappointed to find Chef Kevin Souza who just arrived here weeks ago has now moved on again to Nine on Nine (3rd move this summer for this talented chef).  The space is very nice.  It is full of deep reds which automatically relax and a nice dining area.  The bar next to the dining area is a little bizarre because the seats are too low to the ground and force you to feel like your sitting at the kiddies table with you barely able to put your elbows on the bar.  I asked about the ackward seating and was told it has to do with them buying a bar that was too tall and insurance issues on getting properly fitted seating.  They have great big leather seats for lounging with your cocktails which are a nice touch.  They've also recently added outdoor and rooftop seating which is great on a warm autumn day.  The service was a little below average.  We had a very unenthusiastic chap named Mick who didn't commit any major faux pas, but it was clear this was not were he wanted to be.  The wine selection is okay.  They have a few more expensive interesting options, but the waiter didn't offer any suggestions or seemed trained at all on the description of the bottles.  The bread was okay. I'm guessing breadworks bread served with this interesting pomogranite and onion butter.  The flavors worked okay for the butter, but I would have been more pleased if the butter and bread were served warm.  I ordered the salmon tartare which had a nice flavor seasoned with cilantro and mango, however the fish itself was a little warmer than room temperature.  This is not good for tartare. It should be served slightly chilled.  Fiona had the scallop appetizer which was served on this extremely bland breadcrumb type pancake.  The scallop itself was delicious and cooked perfectly however for $12 I think one deserves more than one average sized scallop.  I had the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly and very flavorful, however the greens that accompanied were bland.  They don't put salt and pepper on the tables which is okay and I've been to other fine dining where this occurs.  However, if they won't provide the flavor enhancers they should be spot on with the seasoning.  Red room is not.  Fiona had the strip steak which was $42. This seems a bit much for strip.  It was very fatty and had a weird chemical flavor. I'm guessing from a charcoal bricket.  It was edible, but I've had better steaks at TGIF.  We skipped dessert.  The bill including tip was $180.  This place is overpriced for the quality of food and serving size.  I'd be okay paying this cost if I was trying something unique like I was hoping for with Chef Souza, however they have re employed an old sous chef who is now doing the cooking and in my opinion does not justify the cost.  It's a shame because I'm sure they've put a lot of money in overhauling the restaurant, but this won't be a top notch restaurant until they get better talent in the kitchen or reduce their prices.  This place probably deserves 2.5 stars.\",\n",
       " 283: 'This place is  located in a pretty fun place, south side works.  I  like the interesting shops in the area and a few restaurants.  Unfortunately, many of the restaurants are national chains like this one.  However, this place knows what it is doing.  You won\\'t be blown away, but I\\'ve never had a bad meal here.  I went today with a couple friends and sat at the bar.  The space is nice enough with plenty of seating and high ceilings.  The bar area is pretty nice with a few hightops scattered about.  On the weekends this place can get pretty busy at the bar.  Today we were the only ones there.  The bartender Jen used to  work here and then she was at the Library down the street and now she\\'s back again.  She\\'s competent and friendly enough.  She said she makes a terrific bloody mary, so we ordered a few.  The bloody mary was very spicy and very strong.  It was a  good bloody mary and certainly wouldn\\'t take more than two of these to wake you up in the am.  We started out with a nice very fresh sourdough bread with butter.  The sourdough was great.  I\\'m thinking \"Breadworks\".  I tried a smoked salmon appetizer that was served with red onions, capers, and chopped eggs.  It was very much a brunch dish.  The salmon was tasty and their were plenty of toppings.  The salmon was served on these crispy crackers with some type of flavorless sauce.  When  you  bite into the crackers the whole thing basically explodes.  It\\'s not a very user friendly way to serve the salmon.  This would have been much better with just a bagel and some cream cheese.  I tried a friends \"Firecracker\" rolls.  It was basically a chicken egg roll.  It was okay, but not memorable.  He also ordered a reuben which he said was good.  I tried one of his fries that looked good, but was kind of mushy instead of crispy.  I had a tilapia which was served encrusted with some type of nut (pecans maybe, don\\'t quite  recall).  It was cooked perfectly and quite frankly a little too big for a lunch portion.  Served with a nice tasty rice pilaf and some green beens.  This was good, but heavier than I would have liked with the topping on the fish.  Overall this place does fish quite well.  The dinners are a bit overpriced, but again it is a franchise.  This is a perfectly suitable option in the south side works.',\n",
       " 284: 'I had lunch here last week mainly because of its convenient location.  Tom and I are considering leasing some office space in the building and thought we needed to gather all the information neccessary to make an informed decision (local bar and restaurant obviously having a solid influence).  I wasn\\'t too excited to have lunch here I had wanted to try it years ago when Kevin Sousa gained local and some national attention for his alchemy menu, however that was several restaurants ago for Kevin and I believe he is now at Nine on Nine.  Anyways, we got there at about 1145 I think on Thursday.  The waitress came over and took our drink orders and then left us alone for a little too long... about 20 minutes however she probably thought we were busy since there was blueprints everywhere.  She finally came over and was friendly enough and took our order.   The space itself is minimalist with earth tone colors and a well stocked bar in the back.  It has hardwood floors plenty of sunlight and in general is a very adequate space and it\\'s good there is a seperate entrance on the side to get to the restaurant without having to walk through the hotel lobby.  We started with some cold bread and cold oil of some type, kind of meh\\'.  Again, I wasn\\'t expecting too much from this hotel restaurant.  I started with a cup of there soup of the day which was a spicy black bean soup, that was surprisingly... well... delicious I\\'d say.  My only complaint is that it wasn\\'t that spicy and was served only slightly warm, not pipin\\' hot how most soup should be.  I ordered the BLT that came with Pierogies as an option for a side instead of just regular fries or a veggie.  The Pierogies were really good served perfectly sauteed with good potato and cheese filling and perfectly caramalized onions and sour cream.  i was really happy with this side, not just because it was an option as a side, but because it was executed perfectly.  My BLT was also really good.  It wasn\\'t just normal or crispy bacon it was thick braised pork/bacon with a reallly delicious flavor served on really good quality sour dough bread with a nice slaw of some type instead of just lettuce.  The price was also good at $10 for the sandwich and sides.  It was a healthy portion. Speaking of prices I thought my cup of soup was a bit overpriced in comparison at $6 for the cup.  Tom had the \"Cheese Steak\", which wasn\\'t steak at all but braised short ribs served wtih good quality amish chedder.  The fact that these folks put such care into the lunch menu makes me want to go back for Dinner.  I was pretty impressed and pleasantly surprised by this lunch spot and may be another check in the plus column in influencing to add space in this area.  I probably should give this place four stars, but I\\'ve been told recently that I\\'m too generous with the stars so maybe I\\'m a bit self conscious.  In either case I\\'ll be back.',\n",
       " 285: \"This is a good steakhouse.  It's mostly what you would expect if you've been to this type of place in other cities.  I do like that they tailor the art to reflect the local history.  The bartenders are excellent.  I especially like Seth.  Unlike Mortons and Ruth Chris the bar is a lot of fun.  The crowd is similiar to the other steak places, but seem to me to be a bit younger.  The steaks are what you'd expect and they are excellent.  However, and this may just be my personal opinion I'd stay away from some of the exotic preparations (like coffee beans) and just stick with a good piece of meat.  I really liked the spinach.  They put just the right amount of nutmeg to give it an interesting taste.  The other sides are about average.  If I had to rank these steak places I mentioned in this review I'd have to say the Capital Grille is the current favorite.  I'd like to find a local place that is on par with these franchises, since I'd much prefer to support local business owners.\",\n",
       " 286: 'I went there last night with a few friends.  We had all heard great things and were not disappointed at all.  We arrived at the bar about 30 min. prior to reservation and had a couple glasses of wine from their extensive selection.  The wine prices are pretty reasonable considering some of the other \"wine bars\" in town.  I\\'d say the price is 2x to 3x cost.  I order a bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay at Sonoma Grille this weekend and the price was 5x cost.  So, with respect to the competition I guess 2x isn\\'t bad.  The bartender was professional and I\\'ve seen her at other places.  Her name is Holly and she is attentive and welcoming.  One small issue was that the floor by the bar was sticky which was kind of weird.  The overall atmosphere is warm and inviting.  We were sat at a fine table with perfect lighting.  Our waiter was great.  I also noticed another great waiter, Raj, who used to work at Nine on Nine and Eleven.  It seems to me that the Chef/Owner took special care in his staff hiring.  The Maitre\\'D is also helpful and experienced.  Okay..., the food.  We started with  a nice selection of warm bread which was on par, but nothing special.  We then ordered steak tartare, belgian endive salad, and mushroom ravioli as appetizers.  The steak tartare was delicious.  It was served with a quail egg and perfectly toasted ciabatta.  The belgian endive was okay, but not memorable.  It should have had more walnuts and cheese and less endive.  The ravioli was rich and delicious served with oxtail which I thought was interesting.  The entrees\\' were awesome.  I had the beef short ribs which they are known for and it without a doubt the best I\\'ve ever had and one of the \"richest\" dishes I\\'ve ever had.  Another friend had the lamb which was perfect and another dish sampled was the roasted chicken.  Thomas Keller has said his favorite meal on earch is roasted chicken and I can see why after sampling Mio\\'s.  The portions were perfect.  One of my pet peeves is huge portions and this place does not fall into the trap.  The prices are more than most, but the ingredients are stellar.  There was no room for dessert.  We finished the evening at the bar with a few more drinks and spoke with Matt who is the chef/owner.  He told us all about stories of Mario Batali and the like in NYC where he was sous chef at Veritas.  We are lucky to have a chef this talented in Pittsburgh.  Mio is my favorite NEW restaurant and deserves your visit.  They are also going to start serving lunch in April.  So, you\\'ll be able to sample the same quality without the same pricetag as dinner.',\n",
       " 287: 'I went to Bona Terra last night for the first time after hearing about it for years.  It was like a great first date with me thinking about the experience much of today.  Chef Douglas Dick is nationally recognized with recognition in some of the national food magazines and has been recognized with an award for one of the best \"farm to table\" restaurants in the country.  He\\'s all about the best ingredients and the menu changes daily because of that.  When you make a reservation they call you back to confirm and give advice with respect to parking and other details.  Great start!  It\\'s located in sharpsburg which is a working class part of pittsburgh.  The restaurant is right across from the \"family dollar\" retail store and located on the same street with many \"shot and a beer\" establishments.  The space itself is, well.... not nice.  What can I say?  He must really want the focus on the food.  The lighting is bad.  The ceilings are low.  The furniture is Ikea or walmart and the bathroom is tiny.  The silverware is target and the plates are uninteresting.  The service is slightly above average, but still mostly 20somethings working till they  figure out what they really want to do.  The Maitre\\'d, Adam was actually very good and helpful and honored our request for a printout of the impromptu tasting menu we requested.  But, the FOOD!  OMG is the food incredible.  The food is on par with some of the better restaurants I\\'ve been to coast to coast, not the best, but this can stack up in any city.  A friend that I had lunch with suggested that we ask for a tasting menu.  We didn\\'t even look at the menu and just asked the server to ask the chef to make us as many dishes of whatever he wanted with no restrictions.  I suggest you do the same, but Kathy said they usually won\\'t do this on the weekends, so better to try for a weekday.  Ok, the meal started with an amouse bouche (sp?) which was a piping hot cauliflower soup.  It was pretty good, but not memorable.  The first course was amazing.  It was a perfectly caramalized dayboat scallop with a strawberry chutney and a 20 yr. aged balsamic.  This combination was the best scallop I\\'ve ever tried.  It was like the first time you had ice cream.  The next dish was a pan seared grouper with vegetables.  This dish was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully, but for me it wasn\\'t memorable.  The seared tuna with microgreens and candied kumquats (what! as if kumquats werent\\' sweet enough) and toasted almonds was delicious.  The \"prime\" lamb chop came next and was the best lamb chop I ever had paired perfectly with collard greens.  The waiter then asked us if we could still keep going, we said bring it on, so finally was a kobe beef sirloin, which was rich and unlike any steak I\\'ve ever had.  The desserts were okay, but nothing special.  I actually didn\\'t care for the lemond tart, but really liked the coconut lime sorbet.  The bread served with dinner was just out of the oven and served with this interesting cherry butter.  The pacing could have been a little faster we took about 3 hours with dinner which certainly could have been 2 1/2 hours.  Overall a great chef that we are lucky to have.  The portions were reasonable and no one felt uncomfortable after all these courses and the price was about $70 each, which is very reasonable considering the quality and the fact that is BYOB.  I can\\'t wait to visit Bona Terra again.',\n",
       " 288: \"This place recently moved up the street from the awful location prior.  The owner (mantini) is really trying hard to make this one work.  However, even though he's hired sales help he still suffers from a lack of marketing.  It's not enough just to have good food in the upscale casual market.  As far as I know they don't even have a website.  This new spot is much nicer than the old with exposed brick, fireplace, plenty of roomy seating, marble bar and redesigned menu.  They also have a unique bar in the back directly exposed to the kitchen area.  I was here recently on Friday for dinner and sat at the bar.  The bartenders are pretty good with my favorite being Harry whose been with mantini for four years and is a former cook.  This place probably is more of a winter restaurant, but  deserves your business in the summer if for nothing less the cocktails served with fresh squeezed orange, grapefruit, etc.  The food is pretty good but a little uneven.  The pulled pork quesadillas are good and I had the salmon special on Friday cooked perfectly with a maple glaze and served nicely with sauteed spinach and green beans.  In the past I've tried the filet which is a decent cut of meat, but not prime I suspect.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare and I really like their choices of sides.  I have tried the ribs before, but surprisingly wasn't that impressed.  They were doing good biz. on a Friday in the summer.  I'm guessing this new spot may be here for a while.\",\n",
       " 289: 'I was here last night and was relatively impressed with the beautiful space.  I didn\\'t get a chance to sit in the dining room, but the bar area itself was pretty nice with plenty of seating and a better than average tequila selection.  They also had plenty of draft beer options . The area itself has high ceilings,nice lighting, beautiful ceiling fans, really dark wood, a couple of plasmas and plenty of leather.  The wine selection is decent and has plenty of options by the glass.  We ordered a few of the \"small plates\" while we sat at the bar.  However, you have the option to order off of the full menu, small plates menu, and bar menu.  I think it\\'s a bit silly to have three different menus for your options while you sit at the bar.  It seems that if you can order anything off of any menu then their is no need for three different menus.  Anyways, we started with the beef carpaccio, which was a bit above average served with parmigiano-reggiano, olive oil and roasted peppers.  The flavors melded pretty well together and the roasted peppers were nice albeit a bit oversoaked in olive oil.  The tuna tartare was okay.  I guess the tuna was of decent quality, but it was served a bit above room temperature which is a mistake. I think tartare should be served room temperature or a bit below.  I really liked the cured meats selection, which was served with a nice selection of olives and three different meats.  The prosciutto (sp?) was delicious and served room temperature which is correct.  We also had a few slices of a delicious salami and sopressata.  This is a good option for under $7.  In fact overall I found the prices to be quite reasonable.  Finally, we ended with a trio of delicious lamb burgers.  This was my favorite from last night.  It was three perfectly cooked medium flavorful lamb burgers served with perfectly caramalized onions on warm, buttery soft bread with a sheeps milk blue cheese.  I really appreciated this cheese because it was a milder blue cheese and did not overpower the meat.  We stopped in the cigar bar after dinner and I was quite pleased with the space.  We sat on the comfy large leather couches and were served our martinis quickly.  Overall this is a good place and I\\'m glad to see we have a decent cigar bar in Pittsburgh.  I\\'ll sample the full dinner menu the next time I visit.',\n",
       " 290: 'I can\\'t believe I\\'m about to say this, but I had quite possibly one of the best burgers of my life here on Wednesday night.  It ranks definitely in the top 5 right up there with \"In n Out\" on the left coast and of course Tessaros.  It was definitely better than the last burger I had at Tessaros or the City Grill in the SouthSide.  It\\'s possible I\\'m being a bit \"hyperbolic\", (love it when I get a chance to use words like this!!) in that I was really hungry and I had no expectations whatsoever of this place.  Annie and I had just left Kinkos in the NH (wild and crazy wednesday night!) and I was hungry.  She mentioned this joint in the northside because she knows I love Guiness and since it\\'s an irish pub they would be sure to have this nectar of the gods.  It\\'s located right along all of the rowhouses in the mexican war streets in the north side and if it wasn\\'t for the irish flag hanging out front you\\'d most likely be sure to miss it.  The space itself is perfect.  You enter off the street and you end up directly in the long bar with dark wood.  There are also plenty of two person booths right behind the stools at the bar.  Cozy is probably the perfect term to describe this place.  They have an additional dining room in the back, but I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ll never use it.  The booths are perfect for two people and provide just the right amount of privacy.  If you look closely there is a lot to admire with respect to the space itself (mohogany boothes, crown molding, plenty of brass)  The crowd seems mostly regulars, young physicians in their scrubs,,, older grinders at the bar, plenty of 20 and 30 somethings in everything from Jeans to Suits.  We luck out because it\\'s $6 burger night and that\\'s exactly what I plan on ordering.  I start with a perfectly poured Guinness stout and Annie has a relatively stiff vodka/tonic.  We started with a very good cup of french onion soup with plenty of cheese and seasoned perfectly with caramalized onions and a rich broth.  I ordered the \"British Isles Burger\" which was a healthy portion (guessing 8 oz.) of fresh (most likely ground that morning) perfectly seasoned (tons of flavor) medium (cooked perfectly) ground beef.  It was served on a warm toasted buttered fresh roll overflowing with Gloucester cheese and for additional flavor sprinkled with chives and onions.  They also included some type of sauce on the side, but this burger was perfect no need for any additions.  Annie had just a regular cheeseburger with ketchup which looked good, but a little plain compared to the beauty I was enjoying.  The fries were also perfect, thick cut steak fries double dipped in oil and fried for the perfect crunch.  Parking can be a little tough and it\\'s not exactly the best neighborhood, but I promise it\\'s worth the effort.  They have other traditional pub fare which I may try on my next visit.',\n",
       " 291: 'This is a great, no a grand location on grandview ave.  The view is amazing and it has one of the best decks in Mt. Washington and plenty of outdoor seating.  It is a must visit in the summer when you can view the beautiful Pittsburgh vista in all its wonder.  I\\'ve been coming here for almost a decade and while I give the place much deserved kudos for a fantastic location and wonderful deck the food is another story.  I guess it\\'s best to start with a little background the current incarnation is the \"coal hill steakhouse\" at the Grandview Saloon.  Most regulars still refer to the place as the Grandview for obvious reasons.  In all the years I\\'ve been a patron I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever had dinner in one of the dining rooms.  The entrance has two sets of stairs, one leading downstairs to the bar and wonderful deck and the other two leading to two dining rooms upstairs.  The carpeting and general decor of the dining rooms is dated and the food used to be, well in a word... awful.  It\\'s a little better now, but not close to what I would consider good food.  The owner is a surgeon who clearly uses this venue for tax purposes probably without a lot of consideration given necessarily to the quality of the product.  Again, the view is great from all areas of the restaurant and this place does most of its business in the summer when folks appreciate the outdoor seating more.  The food has improved lately in its most recent incarnation as a \"steakhouse\".  Let me back up,,, besides kudos for the view the staff is very corteous and friendly.  I had lunch here today and was the only visitor to the bar for the couple hours I was there and had a good conversation with Rose who was working a very tame sunday shift.  Charlie and Dana are also excellent bartenders.  The bar seats about 15 with plenty of hightops and again lots of outdoor deck seating for the summer.  It has three huge plasmas with plenty of sporting options.  They maintain a decent wine menu and have plenty of beer options, including guiness on tap.  Charlie and Dana also make a reasonably good dirty martini.  If you are looking for a place that is not crowded on a Sunday to watch football you could do a lot worse.  Okay, now to the food.  I\\'ve ate here multiple times and never really had a good meal.  The steak prices are unreasonable I believe for the quality of the product and it\\'s not possible to get a steak less than 14 oz. and $40 plus dollars unless you orderr a filet.  They offer the filet in a 6 oz. and 10 oz. option.  I still think the $30 plus pricetag is a bit much for the 6 oz. filet.  I think they say it\\'s prime, but in my experience the steaks don\\'t stack up to those of mortons or ruths.  Today I ordered a cup of french onion soup, which was probably the highlight of the meal with a nice crouton, tasty broth, and plenty of melted guyerre (sp?) cheese.  I then ordered a cheesesteak sandwich and asparagus instead of fries.  The cheesesteak was a huge serving, but of relatively flavorless meat underseasoned on a stale non toasted bun.  The asparagus were tiny and had way too much salt.  If this place puts itself out as a prime steakhouse the asparagus should be much better and the steak should have some flavor.  They also charge an additional $3 for veggies instead of fries on top of the cost of the sandwich platter.  The view is 5 stars, service 4 stars and food 2 stars.',\n",
       " 292: 'The lady and I went here last night kinda on a whim\\'.  We\\'ve been meaning to check out the new casino and figured on a Tuesday night it shoudn\\'t be too busy and it wasn\\'t.  We got there around 7 PM and pull up to the valet (which is complimentary with a players card-which is free), so I see no reason not to valet.  The entrance to the casino itself is quite grand especially for Pittsburgh.  I won\\'t spend a lot of time describing the casino except to say the crowds were okay, probably a little better than mountaineer.  I was able to find a blackjack \"table\", which is with a video dealer, but I had just as much fun and won enough to pay for dinner x 2 in about 30 minutes and Annie found some nickel slots.  There are mulitiple restaurants from casual to fast food to their take on \"fine dining\".  We tried the \"fine dining\" option which was Andrews.  It\\'s a very lovely place.  Inside there are high ceilings, ornate lighting, big bar with a friendly bartender and plenty of tables/booths.  However, what I really appreciated was the outdoor seating.  We were able to sit right on the railing on the sidewalk on  a gorgeous early fall night.  I like how the trim of the huge casino changes colors and during the early evening it was quite beautiful.  We were greeted quickly enough by our main server \"Bill\" who was working in conjunction with \"Joya\".  Overall they were pretty good and I\\'ve been told jobs here are a hot commodity, so chances are your server will be a professional.  We started with a couple drinks.  I had a dirty martini, ketel one, rocks...which was quite good, however Annie wasn\\'t as lucky with a weak and sour vodka/tonic.  We started with a couple appetizers.  I ordered a half dozen oysters, which were surprisingly good.  I think you\\'re typically not suppose to order oysters this time of year, but Bill said they were from Nova Scotia, so I guess it was alright.  They were plump, fresh and briny.  It was served with a pretty forgettable mignonette sauce and cocktail sauce.  We also tried the \"hot off the rock\" more of a novelty item than anything else.  It\\'s servedon \"volcanic rock\" and you cook the meat yourself.  They serve it with a trio of sauces and it\\'s tuna, beef, chicken and ahi tuna.  It was fine and kinda fun, but taste wise no better than anything you\\'d get at any hibachi around town.  They had a very nice selection of bread served warm with good quality butter and hawaiian rock salt (big fan of hawaiian rock salt, refer to tomatoe mozz review at the carlton).  The two person table was a bit small for this beginning, but we made do.  I guess I suggest if you want to order some of the bigger plated items like the hot rock and oysters, maybe have them serve one before the other.  Annie had the sirloin (12 oz.) with mashed potatoes.  The steak was a bit overcooked and the mashed potatoes were good, but not capital grille or ruth\\'s good even though they were charging ruths\\' prices.  I had the King Crab which is technically considered with them an accompaniement, but at $40 that would be one hell of an add on.  THe portion itself was large enough and the crab was cooked well, and they did crack them for me.  However, when I spend $40 on \"king\" crab legs I expect monster crab legs these were closer the cheaper snow crab version.  I added on for $10 the trio of sides of which I picked the mushrroom fricassee (okay, but not flavorful), onions (forgettable) and au gratin (quite good).  Most of their  entrees are served with sides except steaks and certain seafood like lobster.  Overall I found the quality good, but not deserving the $200 including tip with two drinks each it cost me, not including dessert.  If I go back I\\'ll try to go for the cheaper lunch or hopefully by then be getting \\'comped\\'.  Again, not a bad place with good service but definitely not in the same atmosphere as Capital Grille or even Hyde Park.',\n",
       " 293: 'Le Mont or should I say \"the le mont\" like my yinzer brethren is what you would expect it to be if you are from this town.  Now, if you are from out of town it is truly one of he most beautiful vistas you can see whlle dining in any city.  I\\'ve eaten here maybe a dozen times and a few years ago hosted about 30 nights while presenting seminars.  As an aside this is a good spot for business functions because it has good name recognition, professional staff and a restaurant manager who will negotiate costs.  Anyways, I was here again on Monday and the fact that we were there probably dropped the average age a few decades, which is fine.  This is definitely the kind of place your parents and grandparents would like.   It was a Monday and at first when we were cocktailing at the bar seemed relatively empty, but actually to my surprise filled up through the evening with elegant gents and ladies wearing there sunday or monday best\\'.  The restaurant itself is classically elegant.  BIg beautiful chandeliers, lots of ornate woodwork and crystal, bold colors and a baby grand\\' elevated above the dance floor.  After a guinness (bonus) at the bar we were seated at a big table right on the glass.  The view was sublime, however there were a few dead flies on the inside ledge a few inches from where we were seated.  The waiter was there quickly to get our drink orders and explain the features.  He was a professional server and was pretty much spot on from start to finish.  The features of course, were seafood (restaurant trying to clear out leftover seafood from the weekend) there was a platter with lobster tail, coquille, and a few other items.  I didn\\'t try it, but Garrett and Tom said it was good, I\\'m sure the quality wasn\\'t that great, but it was a large portion.  We started with a few apps\\'.  They were calamari (nothing special, overpriced at $13), also the brie (chambord brie stuffed with apricots, apples and pecans finished with an apple glaze).  This was pretty delish, but at $14 again a bit high and the final app\\' was oysters bienville (oysters topped with asiago, crab and spinach).  This was okay, but again the same theme here overpriced for quality.  A few folks had the ceaser salad which was fun because it was prepared tableside.  I was told it was very good.  Megan got some chicken dish with pineapple.  It looked pretty good and not dry.  Tom and Keith had some type of preperation of veal, which they both said was excellent served with perfectly cooked root vegetables and mashed potatoes.  Matt had the steak diane, which is fun again because it\\'s two small filets prepared tableside with a nice demi-glaze.  I had the lamb which were several small lamb chops lightly breaded with a mustard type glaze and breading.  It was okay and I will admit I ate all of it, however it was a bit more \"gamey\" than it should have been.  There were several desserts sampled and most were palatable.  Megan tried some coffee at the end, however the cream was spoiled.  THe waiter quickly replaced.  This is a place you should take out of town guests, however if it\\'s my \"dime\", which it usually isn\\'t when I\\'m here you can do better elsewhere.  You are easily paying a 20% premium for the view and it is pretty much the opposite of \"hip or trendy\", which isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing.  The service is 4 stars, the food 2 stars or less because of price, but the view is 5 stars.  Go at least once and sadly that\\'s probably enough.',\n",
       " 294: 'A T.G.I. Friday\\'s is a T.G.I. Friday\\'s. You either like it or hate it. This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash-up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid-back lounge feel and there\\'s nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise (and like other Friday\\'s, it\\'s not particularly easy to eat here if you\\'re anything other than a meat lover).\\n\\nHonestly I wasn\\'t expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group (as it says on the T.G.I. Friday\\'s website that it\\'s ideal to call ahead when you have a large party). However, I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations. So my friends and I looked elsewhere, and finally walked across the street to Friday\\'s after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were. At least Friday\\'s only had a 15 minute wait.\\n\\nOnce we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully. I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us, but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen. Kudos. The food, as I mentioned earlier, was standard T.G.I.Friday\\'s. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not that exciting either. I had actually found one of the only low-calorie items on the menu at the last minute - a steak and vegetable dish - and standard or not I was honestly pretty happy with it. My steak was surprisingly juicy, came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all (I\\'d ordered a medium temperature steak), and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu. Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail, which mixed so much rum, fruit juice, sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head. It was worth it, though - that drink was a sweet, tall cup of Heaven.\\n\\nThis T.G.I.Friday\\'s really fits my exact definition of an \"a-ok\" place - it\\'s not terrible, nor is it not exceptional. It\\'s just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink. I\\'d consider coming back again, but admit that they wouldn\\'t be my first choice so much as a solid back-up plan for when other Waterfront eateries are super busy.',\n",
       " 295: 'If I had written this review before today, Getaway Cafe would have gotten 4 stars. As of now, though, I have sadly had to bump the place down to a 3 and have declared it \"ok\" - I would have declared it to be a \"meh\" had I not experienced better times here in the past.\\n\\nPreviously, my meals here were all wonderful: the French onion soup is delicious and I order it every time I come here, plus the wraps, burgers, gyro and pasta dishes are usually also quite tasty, and the great decorations and atmosphere in the dining hall by the bar put the cherry on top of a near perfect place for me to eat.\\n\\nNow, though, I\\'ve finally had a dud of a meal here. As usual, the French onion was pretty darn good and warranted no complaints - but my main course, not so much; after reviewing the menu, I thought, \"A steak hoagie? With lettuce, tomato, and cheese, plus mushrooms if I ask? Heck yes!\" Turns out despite the menu promising most of the toppings off the bat, either the cook forgot or someone new made my hoagie. It was just meat, cheese and mushrooms, all on a rather tasteless hoagie bun. Bleh. That sandwich was barely touched at the table. I did take it home in the hopes of improving it for later meals. And if nothing else, I did get a pile of french fries with my hoagie, and Getaway Cafe remains the master of the perfect french fry!\\n\\nI haven\\'t lost all hope, especially since I went with a friend who had what looked like a really good pasta special. I certainly won\\'t be ordering a steak hoagie here again, though!',\n",
       " 296: 'I have been a fan of this Applebee\\'s since I was a little girl who would come here and only eat their amazing cheeseburgers and layered chocolate cake. I was heartbroken when said layered chocolate cake was taken off of the menu, but now that I\\'m of legal age, other parts of the menu have made up for this. More on that later.\\n\\nI think compared to other restaurants in the chain, this Applebee\\'s is a little bit smaller than other places, but the essentials are all there: comfy seating, a bar, TVs, and most importantly: good service. Plus, it has the essential Applebee\\'s staple: a darn good menu. (Well, I think it\\'s good anyway. If you like Applebee\\'s menus in other lcoations, you\\'ll like the one here.) In recent years it\\'s also adopted a \"light option\" menu, which is positively delicious and provides perfect alternatives to things like that tasty but not-so-good-for-me burger I used to eat on a regular basis. Fortunately, steak with shrimp and potatoes and the perfect balance of spices on top make up for my inability to always indulge in my original favorite meal.\\n\\nAlso: this place is home to one of the biggest margaritas I\\'ve ever seen. Joe\\'s Crab Shack still takes the prize for 1st place, but 2nd is no small feat (no pun intended) and this place is much closer and easier for me to get to. Also, free parking - always a big plus.\\n\\nAll in all, I still enjoy stopping in here for a good meal, and I plan on continuing to come here in the years to come.',\n",

My friends and I come here all the time, and we've never been disappointed - there's a reason we keep coming back and it's not just that Joe Mama's is affordable. When I brought a date here we shared an enormous salad and bowl of soup, and neither of us could believe just how good such a simple meal tasted. I even had a birthday dinner here and kindly look back on the memories of us sharing such amazing food together - we ordered all of their appetizers and just passed them up and down the table until they were gone.\\n\\nWant a cocktail or martini? Get one here; they're fantastic and are usually a little stronger than I expect them to be. Their sangria and beer selection? Also wonderful. Need an appetizer? Go for the bruschetta. Yum!\\n\\nTheir menu changes a little bit throughout the year, but it's also reasonably varied. Pizza, pasta, sandwiches, salads, soups - it's all delicious. Their mozzarella and steak salad is one of the best things I've ever eaten (I wish they'd bring it back, but again: menu changes periodically) and I can't even praise their pasta enough.\\n\\nThe servers have always been kind - very accommodating for my friends who can't eat gluten as well. I'm not fond of the actual entrance, which is tiny and results in traffic jams if people are trying to come and go all at once.\\n\\nI guess some people consider this place a lost cause - I consider it a favorite eatery and look forward to when I can return.\",\n",
       " 298: \"I'm a big fan of this place! I've had the chance to eat dinner here as well as eat off-menu light bites when organizations I'm a member of have booked lunch here. I've also had the chance to enjoy a quick tour of their wine stocks, which honestly are impressive in and of themselves! Not only did I get a glimpse into the huge collection of wine but I found out that they have quite a system here to ensure that different wines are ready for serving throughout the night. So yep, when it comes to wine it's safe to say that these guys definitely know what they're doing.\\n\\nFood wise, I can say after dining here during group outings that Capital Grille makes very delicious and tender meat dishes. I've had off-menu lamb bites and kabobs and can't even describe how tasty they were! The last time I was here for dinner I opted to stick to soup and salad, and believe it or not those options were just as satisfying as anything else I could have ordered. The bisque was thick and nicely seasoned, and the Caprese Salad was put together beautifully and drizzled with just the right amount of dressing - and hey, I love any place that doesn't drown its salads in dressing! And to finish my last meal off, I ordered the cheesecake with fresh seasonal berries. It was definitely one the best pieces of cheesecake that I've ever had, I think - it was both tasty and light and fluffy, so I left after eating feeling perfectly full rather than overstuffed from my delightful meal.\\n\\nService? No complaints. I've never had a problem here. The waiters here are always able to answer questions and help with meal and drink selections when we're having trouble picking what to pair with what. They've also always been quick to check on our waters, take away empty dishes, see if we need anything else - honestly they've always succeeded in making me feel like a special guest, which in a place as fancy and expensive as Capital Grille is always a good thing, I think!\\n\\nI would absolutely come back for a big date or just to grab a drink and dessert, but unfortunately Capital Grille will always be a special occasion only sort of place. It's impossible to forget that the food here is expensive - particularly the steaks! - and while I don't mind paying for a high quality meal like the ones you can get here once in a while, those prices do mean that this place and my budget don't always mix well. Darn money, always ruining my fun!\",\n",
       " 299: \"At long last, after years of hearing about this place, I had the chance to eat a meal at Meat & Potatoes. And it didn't disappoint!\\n\\nThe atmosphere in here is really quite interesting - while the place definitely has the look of a modern and comfortable dining area there's lots of little inclusions in decor that make you think about shopping for fresh meat from your local butcher shop. It's kind of hard to describe and has to be seen to be understood, but rest assured, the place looks wonderful and inviting.\\n\\nBut let's be honest, the food is what really matters here! Meat & Potatoes is well-known for serving delicious food. And, well, they do! If you want a great appetizer, go for their grilled bread, which tastes like homemade toasty goodness, especially once you add on the fresh butter and jam that comes with it. As for the main courses, my friend had their special fish tacos (made with tilapia) and I went for a good ol' lamb burger. And yes, both were quite excellent! Something about the ingredients used in them gave what could potentially be considered standard menu fare a unique flavor. My lamb burger for instance had harrisa aioli, arugula and havarti, among other things, rather than the usual onions, American cheese slice, etc. - and the result was delicious perfection. Oh, and the burger? Cooked medium, exactly how I asked! So many places overcook my orders that having a tender, juicy, perfectly cooked burger in front of me was more or less a little piece of Heaven for me.\\n\\nNot only is the food excellent here, but the service is wonderful! The waiters and waitresses are really attentive here. Have empty plates in front of you? Someone will soon clear them away. Do you have a show to go to that night? They'll make a note of that and get your order out ASAP. I really got the impression that they cared about our dining experience and it elevates Meat & Potatoes in my eyes.\\n\\nSo if you have such wonderful things to say, why only give this place 4 stars, I hear you asking? Well...because this place is LOUD. Like, even on a slow Wednesday night, between the loud music and the people talking here, the noises levels here got quite high. I would NEVER want to be here on a Friday or over the weekend, honestly.\\n\\nStill, I'd definitely come back - the food and service really are both quite excellent. And given their prices (not super high but not cheap either) I think in my book this is a great location to keep in mind for special nights out with friends or dates. And who knows? Maybe I'll eventually find the energy to brave the noise and crowds and try their brunch - which I hear is also fabulous!\",\n",

Sometimes, I don't even come here for the pizza. While the pizza is definitely the star of the show, their steak is also pretty tasty as are the sandwiches. \\n\\nThe food is enjoyable but the main reason why this is a go-to for me and my friends is because the service is usually very quick here. There rarely is a wait and the wait staff get us in and out right in time to make it to a movie.

Their specialty is hoagies and they have a number of sizes and meats. They're famous for the battleship but since we were only feeding two people, I got the torpedo and the hubby got the destroyer size of the cheese steak. The sandwiches were loaded with meat and the oil and vinegar dressing added such a nice flavor. I can definitely see why the hoagies here are famous and literally everyone I know knows about this diamond in the rough. \\n\\nNext time you're looking to feed a crowd, skip the sandwich ring and get a battleship or even super battleship.\",\n",

It also has great grilled flavor. However, it kind of tastes like something you can grill at home. The seven burgers they offer on their menu are also quite simple with average toppings, making these burgers more like your cookout burger made at home. So they taste pretty good, nothing too special aside from the fact that they're really big. My gripe with the size of the burger is that it is so large, it completely smashes the bottom bun thinner than a pancake. By the time the burger gets to you, your bottom bun has basically vanished into a soggy layer of mush. If bigger is better, these burgers are up your alley.\",\n",
       " 314: \"Large selection of beer and whiskeys. Food is a hit or miss it seems like. My husband and I were here with two of our friends and although everyone else's food was a miss, mine was a total hit! I ordered the Smashed Potato pizza and it was so darn good. It's like a pierogi pizza but better. The bacon was salty, the lettuce added freshness, tomatoes were sweet, onions added some zing and then topped with a tangy and creamy ranch dressing. Such well-balanced flavors. Unfortunately, I was the only one to really enjoy my meal. My counterparts ordered meatloaf, a meatloaf sandwich and a crab cake sandwich. Folks, don't get the meatloaf here (and I don't know why it was picked by two members of our party). The meatloaf basically was a grilled salisbury steak. The crab cake sandwich was okay, but you'll have better. I'd say this is a good place to drink and to order drinking food (like pizza), but don't venture and get something you wouldn't normally drink with.\",\n",
       " 315: \"Legume is possibly my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. My husband took me here for my birthday this year and not one dish we ordered disappointed us. The menu at Legume changes daily so anything I mention in this review may never be featured again, who knows. With a constantly changing menu, it really goes to show that their ingredients are fresh. The atmosphere is nice - intimate and romantic, but it's also rather simple. No hip modern decor that you'd find at other fancy restaurants in Pittsburgh. In fact, it reminded me of an old banquet hall that they spruced up a tad and turned it into a restaurant. Onto the food. OH MY GOD, I was in heaven. I ordered a corn soup with corn fritters to start. This soup is the best soup I've had. The soup was sweet, but it had a drizzle of chili oil, giving it some spice. And the corn fritters gave it texture and crunch. The entrees we ordered were also out of this world. He ordered a roasted chicken dish and I ordered a steak dish. They were quite simple in the description of ingredients, but Legume perfected them. How? I don't know and I wish I did! Perhaps it's the simplicity in it all and its about the technique in the preparation, not the glitz and glam of fancy ingredients. The chicken and steak were so moist and buttery. The desserts were, again, out of this world. He ordered a chocolate dish and I ordered a cardamom creme br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e. They were rich, but oh so simple. I really enjoy the simplistic approach Legume takes on its atmosphere, as well as its food. It goes to show that you don't need all the frills for a successful dining experience.\",\n",
       " 316: \"Come here for the drinks, not the food. Wide beer selection but the food is overpriced garbage. The menu looks fancy but the execution is not there. For instance, the burgers. On paper, they sound amazing because there are a couple that are more exotic meats, not your typical ground beef. But the bun they put it on, ruins everything. The bun is a crumbly, dry Kaiser roll. The fries here are your typical diner wide steak fries, straight out of the freezer, with no salt or seasoning. And they serve them with an aioli which is ok, but a little rich after a while. Just skip the attempt to be fancy and serve it with ketchup, especially if the fries are anything but fancy. The buffalo bites here are just not worth the price; they are basically popcorn chicken drenched in wing sauce and they're charging you about a dollar a piece. One saving grace for their food is the mussels. The individual size is perfect for $10. However, you might need a side to fill you up, but don't get the frites (fries). You might be better off just getting the large order of mussels all to yourself. Like I said, come for the selection of beer. Save your money and get food at one of the places next door or down the street.\",\n",
       " 317: \"All the hype around this place, it's all true. Both the experience and the food are in line with each other and it's all worth the trouble of finding an open table here. Definitely reserve a table in advance. When my husband and I went, we were lucky to find an open table as walk-ins, possibly because it was a weeknight. We ordered the Devils on horseback, Thai curry mussels (with fries) and the pork belly tacos. Omg the flavors here are so incredibly bold, but not overpowering in any way. The reason for my reduction of one star you ask? I got sick afterwards. I can't exactly pinpoint this meal as the culprit, but I'm almost certain the mussels were it. Despite getting a little sick, I would definitely come back to try something different next time. The food here is just that worth it.\",\n",
       " 318: 'The line out the door is totally worth it. Even in freezing temperatures. Ok, maybe not but hey, you can call and skip the line! (I totally didn\\'t know that)\\n\\nI\\'ve visited Gaucho once way before they expanded the space. I loved it then but I had to check out the new space before writing a review. Despite the added room, it\\'s still rather an uncomfortable experience when coming here because of the cramped \"waiting\" area. However, there is a defined process for ordering and eating, but the board right outside the door will tell you exactly how it works which is great and prevents confusion and chaos. Usually there is a line out the door, which is dependent on when you come here of course. When there is a line out the door, the point from the door to time of ordering is about 30 minutes. Sounds crazy but it isn\\'t that bad! Once you order and they seat you, food comes out in a snap. I think this makes up for the waiting time in line. \\n\\nAnyway. Food: Everything is well seasoned to perfection here. As if the dishes weren\\'t so bold and flavorful already, they have four sauces that are each out of this world. They\\'re all tasty but if you aren\\'t sure, ask them to describe what each sauce is. My favorite is the red one, Pimenton, which is a red pepper type sauce that is just great on everything. When coming here, you\\'ve got to try a steak, whether it\\'s a plate or it\\'s a sandwich; you can\\'t go wrong either way. Personally, I like the plate because you still get bread plus a small salad. However, the sandwiches are huge! The sides are also absolutely amazing, especially the Brussels sprouts. \\n\\nOverall, totally worth the hype (and wait) and it\\'s not that expensive either. If there wasn\\'t such a long line all the time, I\\'d probably come here much more often than I do. I highly recommend Gaucho if you haven\\'t already tried it out for yourself!',\n",
       " 319: \"Verdict: not bad, but never coming back. Overpriced. $44.99 for dinner and $24.99 for salad bar only. \\n\\nWhen my husband and I went, about a quarter of the tables were occupied but yet, there was a 15-20 minute wait to be seated? The concept sounds awesome. Servers come around with different types of meat and you can get as much as you want with the green/red card. Green means to keep 'em coming and red means no more. The meats range from flank steak, lamb, chicken, filet mignon, sausage: all with varying methods of preparation. Although the quality of the meats seem decent, they are extremely over-salted. Possibly to make you drink more, fill you up faster so that you eat less. Sounds like a dirty trick to me, especially when you're paying $45 for it. I only had room for a few types of meat after all was said and done so I'm not sure if it was really worth that high price.\",\n",

And their soft pretzels and beer cheese are one of a kind. The pretzels seem to be seasoned with steak seasoning and it complements the cheese so well. On top of amazing bar food, the prices are so affordable! And they have a nice selection of beer. I love McMinns so much, but I could not give it 5 stars because of the poor service. Every time I go here, it takes forever to get waited on and no one ever comes around to check up on us. There's usually  just a bartender when I go and she's the do it all person so I understand it can get busy. However,  the bartender is usually just standing around chatting with the drinkers and never pays attention to anyone else unless you actually go up to the bar to order, get water, pay, etc. Its a shame because the food is soooo good here!\",\n",

I think the problem with this place (in terms of wait times) is the tables are way too large and they'll seat parties of two at tables that seat six. The menu was small before and it is still small. They replaced the Reuben with a cheese steak this time. We were expecting the quality of food to be the same but sadly, it was not. Our table ordered the soup of the day (cream of cauliflower and leek), mac and cheese, gumbo, halusky and cheese steak along with several cocktails. Of all the dishes we sampled, the soup and mac and cheese were the best. In fact, we could've licked the bowl clean after the mac and cheese. We added hot sauce to it for an additional $.50 and it was worth it. The worst was probably a tie between the gumbo and the cheese steak. The gumbo was basically a shredded beef stew, lacking much depth of flavor. And the cheese steak consisted of mostly bread. The roll they used was perhaps too thick for their small portion of sandwich makings. I remember raving about the homemade pickles before but they fell short this time. I don't think they were ready as pickles yet; this time, they were basically just slices of cucumbers. I really hope they're not cutting corners now after having found some success. \\n\\nDarn.

I wish that we could have parked closer since I am wearing a walking boot (broken foot). But I let that go! \\n\\nThe menu was simple but still a lot to think about. I will have to say thank you to our waiter for providing some really good feedback and putting up with our questions. \\n\\nNice things to share: We picked the grass-fed beef tartare with traditional garnishes. Apparently my first choice of the Pickle Platter with Aioli was a problem for Chris. I found it odd that in the eight (!!) years together I never noticed that he doesn't eat pickled food. Which led to an interesting pickle conversation at dinner. BTW, I love pickled food.... I have never had tartare prepared like this. It came out on a plate like a smushed hamburger with the garnishes all around the sides of the hamburger and then an egg yolk in the middle. The bread came on the side in a basket. I was a little shocked by that display. I mean it looked good but it looked weird. Chris dug in first. I then put aside my weird feelings and made myself a little bread slice with the tartare on the top. Yum. It was great. I still think that the egg put it over the top but we ate it and it was great. \\n\\nEntrees: I ordered the 10oz lamb leg steak with Carolina gold rice, Hakurei turnips and a husk cherry chutney. OMG. So good. Seriously I cannot talk about how good this dish was. First, the turnips were amazing. I was apprehensive about the turnips but these were adorable, mini, and had an amazing flavor. The lamb steak was cooked to perfection with the chutney on the top it was amazing. The flavor of the steak combined with the chutney. WOW. The rice was interesting. It was in smaller pellets, more like quinoa than rice. But still was nice. I would have like to have something green or another color on the plate but the dish was great. \\n\\nChris ordered the braised chicken paprikash with hand cut noodles, broccoli, chives, and creme fraiche. Yummy. I took a few bites. The chicken was thigh meat. Which is interesting because Chris does not like thigh meat. (This I do know.) He said it tasted really good and was happy with his dish. The bites that I tasted were really good. The fresh pasta I think was the star of the dish. It was so fresh and great tasting. The broccoli were only a few bunches and were just ok. Nothing that special. The sauce was also good, but not above and beyond. Still the dish was good. \\n\\nDessert: Lemon verbana panna cotta with concord grape sauce and a short bread cookie. I ATE ALL OF IT. Seriously, Chris did not even get one bite. I mean he also did not want any so I got to eat it all. The concord grape sauce was sweet and tangy. The panna cotta was flavorful and not too sweet. Yum. \\n\\nWe had a great experience and I am happy that we finally went! I loved the food.

But would the portions be enough? Or was this a sampling menu. \\n\\nI was hungry. I didn\\'t want this $5 menu to turn out to be some sliders and a chicken leg.

The bread was thick and crusty, and did not get soggy even the next day. The corned beef was cut to perfection and the kimchi (brussels sprouts) was spot on. Just enough spice and heat to make me want to try it again. \\n\\nBut, then the rest of the food came out. And let me tell you, that  $5 menu was no joke. The flat breads were so good. I got to try the greens and chilies flatbread. OH MY. The greens were cooked to sweet perfection and when you took a bite it was heaven, with that kick of chilies mixed in. Just enough to make you go, \"WOW\" but not overwhelming. The Patty Melt was amazing. Juicy, cheesy, and the bread was thick and toasted just right.

I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out of The Flintstones in its portion but let me tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot & sweet peppers, a great tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally fell off the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth. \\nEverything was spectacular , it's a restaurant you have to visit if your in the area at least once given you are willing to spend for your meal. $$$$ but you absolutely get what you pay for.\",\n",
       " 336: 'Good place to have a reasonable meal. Cool that everything is made out of an extremely small kitchen that you can see but the food didnt live up to the local hype for me.  Burger tasted alittle bland, and extremely large.   The restaurant is also very \"packed\" tables are very close together. Home fries option but no \\'french fries.\"',\n",
       " 337: 'Just had dinner at Soba with the girlfriend and two friends.  It was a disappointment from top to bottom as we were excited for a very good asian infused dinner but instead experienced an average at best night out.  \\n\\nAt first we were greeted instantly by our server and things started off fine.  However once we placed our drinks it took the staff, I kid you not 25 minutes to make and bring 4 drinks. They would have never been brought if the manager didnt approach the table and ask if everything was ok.  After he finally brought them with the time in mind he did comp our round which was a nice gesture.  The appetizers, which mind you were brought out BEFORE the drinks, without any staff paying attention that fact.  Apps were the best part of the meal.  Korean BBQ Ribs, were dry and really needed the extra bbq sauce to make the rib succulent and still the flavor wasn\\'t anything to write home about. The Rock Shrimp was excellent, very light batter, fantastic lightly spicy sauce and spiced well. same shrimp as Umi.  The Softshell crab was pretty good, the heirloom tomatoes and avocado added a nice touch and the crab was prepared perfectly, soft and a good crisp crunch. \\n\\nWhat really hurt this experience were the entrees. I had ordered the Double Cut Pork Chop and ordered it cooked t\\no the chefs suggestion in preparation when it came out, it was a tough pork chop, noticeable without even cutting into it.  I dealt with it and continued to eat it but overall a tough and dry dish.  The accompaniments such as snap peas, lotus root and mushrooms just seemed very thrown together, and didnt add anything to the taste of the dish, did not mesh well. My friend ordered the Roasted Chicken which was a variation of a chicken ramen soup.  For $22 a ramen entree should be out of this world and it was far from that, and it was work to get the dish into ready condition to be consumed. The girls ordered shareable sushi offerings and found them to be just ok nothing greater than they have had at good sushi restaurants.  \\n\\nThe service was lacking all around our meal.  Apparently it was \"Jam on Walnut St Festival\" which meant that many checked out the soba bar for drinks.  However when I went to the restroom and passed by it looked like a normal bar scene to me.  Not only did our beverages take 25 minutes to arrive.  The waiter never checked up on us after app or entree until we were obviously ready for the table to cleared and when I was served my pork chop I still was left with a butterknife to cut this tough piece of meat.  Had to ask server for a steak knife, which was clearly meant to be served with this dish.  When the girls got their shareable entrees the dumpings they ordered were replaced by shittake mushroom dumplings when they ordered shrimp.  \\n\\nThe ambience of the restaurant is nice but some of our party had trouble seeing as it is extremely dim all around making it tough to read and even see your dish.  There was a lot of cell phones out at tables around us for flash light usage.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t return to Soba it just does not offer enough for me to justify the cost and it looks like right now they are having trouble serving dinner on a saturday night.',\n",
       " 338: 'First of all, I am not a chain restaurant guy.  Growing up in Manhattan and eating out almost every weekend.  Wasn\\'t until I moved to pitt that I even considered trying this place but due to the lack of steakhouses I wasn\\'t getting my \"proper\" fix so I had to.  Couldnt be happier that I made that initial decision.  Consistency is just what you get at The Capital Grille.  Superior service and a consistently delicious meal.  Expensive but for the quality of the steak Id say its well worth the trip.  If you want extraordinary service ask for Horacio, he will make your evening memorable and treat you like royalty.  Beautiful decor as well and not only is your server great but the entire staff is extremely attentive.',\n",
       " 339: 'I feel like the best parts of this restaurant were the appetizers and the Robata.  we tried the Tuna Tartar which was extremely fresh and tasty, the plantain chips were a great addition.  For Robata tried the salmon with miso and the flank steak with teriyaki sauce.  Although this was just a skewer of protein it satisfied me as I felt if I ordered an entree of either dish I would of been slightly disappointed.  For an entree I tried their Lobster Roll, which was tempura lobster, cucumber, avocado.  Entree comes with a lobster tail of fried lobster which was a nice addition.  I felt the menu had too many tempura options for maki, I wanted more of a selection on fresh non-fried rolls. My gf had a salmon maki roll and it was really tasty and had a great amount of fish but it was to simple for me, I am a fan of specialty rolls but felt they were all way to similar.',\n",
       " 340: 'Had dinner here this past Saturday night.  Was wowed from start to finish, was greeted right away and sat for our 8:00PM Reservation.  Had an extremely knowledgeable waitress named Rachel that made fantastic recommendations based on the true preparation of the dishes.  There was too much that we wanted to try on their far from ordinary menu, full of interesting dishes.  We went with the Beef tartar appetizer which was so fantastic, smooth, flavorful and the delicious egg topped it off perfectly.  We also tried the tuna taquitas which were great as well.  The Fried Pickles are a must have, the breading is incredible but they are huge.  For entrees we enjoyed the Moules Frites with White Wine Garlic Broth, which the girlfriend said where some of the best she ever had.  I enjoyed their signature duck dish, this was such fresh meat but what really made it for me was the pastrami edging.  The sauerkraut pierogoies were a nice side of the dish aswell.  Dont miss out on their drinks, this was the best Manhattan cocktail ive ever had!  Also enjoyed a drink called the Perfect Sour, that was a great addition similar to a Pisco Sour.  Will be returning soon with plenty of options to try !',\n",
       " 341: \"Incredible Flavor. Girlfriend and I had to stop in after seeing all the great reviews and it's all so true. The steak is extremely flavorful and tender (skirt steak sandwich). The best steak sandwich I can ever remember having. Great chimichurri sauce to. Girlfriend had the shrimp which was very fresh and you could taste the grilling which I find really nice. We also tried for apps the grilled vegetables and chorizo sausage. Everything was excellent. We will be back very very soon!!\",\n",
       " 342: 'After falling in love with Meat & Potatoes, I felt it was only right to give this chef another chance to wow and impress.  After anxiously awaiting our reservation for upwards of 2 months, the night finally came and I have to say it was well worth the wait and even lived up to the hype.  The restaurant is gorgeous, very gamie, outdoorsy feel to mixed with a almost fine dining decor.  \\nFor appetizers we tried the Dry Aged Tartar, this was the best variety of this dish I have truthfully ever come across.  Delightful large pieces of fine quality beef, encrusted with parmesan, black garlic aoli and the best part truffled eggs.  Put it all together on a piece of the texas style toast served with it and you have a melting genius combination that will leave you salvating.  We also really enjoyed their version of Mac & Cheese, the goat cheese was the real standout here.  A sharp variation, creamy and surprisingly complex.\\nFor Entrees we tried the Wagyu Flank Steak and Seared Scallops.  I have to admit I am no scallop fan but found this dish to be the better of the two, they were absolutely perfectly prepared with a fantastic crunch to top them off. The Flank Steak was very good but I did feel like I could of picked a better Entree to represent the restaurants diversity and expertise, I just think I picked the wrong dish, nothing more.  I was satisfied but not wowed by this steak, I dont really understand the whole Wagyu craze anyway.I would recommend this restaurant to anybody that liked meat and potatoes and likes to stay some what in American Comfort Food.  However this menu is a bit more exotic than M&P.  Service was excellent and knowledgeable as well.',\n",
       " 343: \"Love this place so much. The food is always so delicious always leave feeling extremely satisfied. The service is incredibly slow though, takes FOREVER to our meals! Even during lunch time when there's almost no one there.. I don't understand I always end up eating here for at LEAST two-four hours. Fish is always fresh, lobster is delicate and tasty, and surprisingly the steak is amazing as well. Clam chowder is rich and creamy-- perfect thickness! Love their salads as well. Definitely recommend this place for a date night :) pricey? Definitely, be prepared to spend at least $20/person!\",\n",

       " 345: 'Have been here a few times. The wait staff is always top notch and food is very good. I had the steak and lobster tail. Steak was a perfect medium rare and the lobster was also cooked well. Oysters as an app. they appeared fresh and tasted how they should. Overall like in the past we had a great experience at mitchells which is not something I always expect from a chain.',\n",
       " 346: \"I was here to celebrate Valentine's Day. Yes, some of their dishes are a little bit pricier, BUT it is great for special occasions and well worth it in that regard. The fish was super fresh (don't worry, they have steak options!). I also had to try the lobster mac & cheese-- no complaints from me!\\nGreat restaurant for seafood and special occasions\",\n",
       " 347: 'We were really looking forward to the acclaimed restaurant scene in our hometown of Pittsburgh, after having retired to Arizona 6 years ago.  We had remembered Mitchell\\'s Fish Market as excellent for seafood, as well as (surprisingly) steak. Wow, were we disappointed!!!!!  The near-empty parking lot at 8:00 PM on a Friday was the first clue. The misunderstandings about the reservation and being treated accusingly by the front greeters who were arguing with each other was the second clue.  The lack of availability of the first 3 choices we made from the menu was the third clue.  The shoe really dropped when the food came.  Both my blackened cod, the steamed vegetables with it and the side of asparagus in hollandaise were ALL cold, dry and hard.  The cod portion was tiny.  MY partner\\'s fillet of beef ordered \"medium rare to medium well with some pink\" was black on the outside, dry, cold and very well done.  Others in our party of six had similar experiences with just plain tough batter-dipped and greasy fried fish for one and cold, dry, small portion of \"fresh\" fish for another.  We were told that this place had changed management in the past 5 years.  In light of its poor quality of food at upscale prices, Mitchell\\'s Fish Market deserves to fail and close.',\n",
       " 348: \"I may be a little biased here based on the fact that I've been eating at this place since... I was born.  With that said, I've eaten pizza all of the USA and this is still my absolute favorite place to order Pizza from.  When I come home to Pittsburgh for a visit ordering from Pasquarelli's is a MUST!   It is a true mom and pop pizza dive.  The owners are really nice and man can they cook.  The Pizza is unique.  Handmade dough, homemade sauce, tasty cheese, you name it.  I love this place!\\n\\nIf you order here please don't stop at Pizza!  I've never had a meatball that is better than Mrs. P's meatballs.  They are so good that I don't compare other meatballs to them because it isn't fair to the other cooks.  The Steak Hoagie is also one of my favorites.  This place isn't cheap but this is real handmade food!  If you want cheap pizza go to pizza hut.\",\n",

Unfortunately when I compare this place to the Oakland Uncle Sam\\'s cheesesteak.... well there really is no comparison.  So Peppi\\'s you will certainly do when I am down town... take your three stars and wear it proudly.',\n",

We ordered the \"Pittsburgh Steak Pizza\", the \"BBQ Chicken Pizza\", and a plain cheese pizza for the kids.  The cheese pizza was good, but the Pittsburg and BBQ pizzas were out of this world.  I haven\\'t had a chance to order anything else on the menu but if the Pizza is any indication of overall quality then I can\\'t imagine not likening the hoagies and such.\\n\\nThe Pittsburgh Pizza was unique enough that I\\'m giving this place a 5 star rating.  I tend to only give 5 stars to places that are good and/or unique enough that I\\'d take people from out of town there to eat.  If you are looking for something a little different, and very tasty, give Pizzeria Primos a shot!',\n",

If you are going to try something a little more exotic, like the bone marrow, then I'd suggest you go with a few couples.  Have a few couples order things like bone marrow and have others order things like the Mac & Cheese (Out of this world).  That way everyone can share and you aren't stuck paying for something you may not care for.  \\n\\nIn the end, my experiences at M&P have been pretty excellent.  They have a great drink selection and the food is generally very good.  I highly recommend the pork chop for dinner.  In spite of being very large it was so nice and juicy.  I'd say it was cooked to perfection.\",\n",
       " 352: \"We decided on Sapporo after reading so-so reviews on Ichiban and Benihana's.  This was a nice surprise. Yes, it is not in the best looking area, and yes, the restaurant may not be as nice as a Benihana.  But the food was quite good.  \\n\\nWe had our doubts at first.  We went in the middle of a Sunday afterfoon and the place was empty.  And service seemed to be a little disorganized and distracted.  But once the chef came out and got to work, it was great.  The salad and soup were veyr good, the soup being a little more beefy in flavor than what we were used to.  We then had the fried rice and got a HUGE portion.  We needed a little more soy sauce that what the chef used, but he gladly provided more and the rice was delicious.  \\n\\nThen we moved to the main entrees.  Wife had the Chateaubriand and I had the Tenderloin and Scallops.  The meat, although cooked  just a tad past medium, still melted in your mouth,and the scallops were absolutely the best I've ever had!!  Again, huge portions of meat and vegetables, plus a large portion of noodles. Definitely a plateful.\\n\\nWe did not get the requisite show you get at this kind of restaurant, but we've seen it so many times, it's kinda boring to me.  Instead, we had a nice conservsation with the chef about the Pittsburgh area.  All in all, this was a very pleasant meal, and I'll definitely go back.\",\n",
       " 353: \"I was disappointed here.  I've had much better Steak Tartare, and my Filet was delivered almost Tartare-like (after ordering it medium).  The sides, except for the potatoes au gratin were unimpressive (the creamed corn tasted like the kernels came straight off the cob). The magnum of Sliver Oak was good, though.  But overall, should have gone to Ruth's Chris.\",\n",
       " 354: \"I travel a lot and have eaten at a lot of Hibachi restaurants. I happen to have a project in the Pittsburgh area and was looking for a Hibachi place to take my co-workers. I read several reviews on other Hibachi places and they all sound the same. The typical they are so busy the service sucks and they rush you in and out to turn tables quickly.  I found Sapporo and was very pleased! It is in an odd location but once you step inside, you feel the ambiance of cozy and family style. My party felt the staff was very friendly.\\n\\nI had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice. The others in my group ordered chicken broccoli, and the Sapporo Deluxe which consists of lobster, filet and shrimp. We all got started with the soup and salads, which was a pretty good size. I didn't want to finish it all because I wanted to save room for dinner. Our Chef was one of the most personable Chef's I have encountered. He was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us. My file was delicious and the fried rice was excellent. They make their fried rice from scratch. It's not prepared ahead of time like I see at most Hibachi places. I can definitely tell the difference. My friend Sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not stop raving about the sauce that they used. It is unlike soy sauce or teriyaki sauce. We asked the Chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind. Dan, who ordered the Sapporo Deluxe was very pleased with his meal and couldn't even finish it. Actually we all needed to-go boxes. The portion amount here is incredible. You definitely get your money's worth here!!\\n\\nI would highly recommend this place to Hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in Pittsburgh. I can not stress how different this place is compared to other Hibachi places. I think this restaurant is family owned and not a chain which I can always appreciate. \\n\\nThank you Sapporo for a great Hibachi experience!! I will be back for sure!\\n\\nAnh\",\n",
       " 355: \"The food was alright. Not good. Not bad. And considering the portion, the prices weren't bad either. The service, on the other hand, was terrible. Severely understaffed. Three hours order to check. Worst of all the chef put cooked lobster tail back into the raw shell to serve it. Avoid at all costs.\",\n",
       " 356: 'Sapporo is my favorite Japanese restaurant, period. I\\'ve found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine. \\n\\nSapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pike\\'s hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don\\'t let the location fool you. Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere. There\\'s a bar at the front, some tables to the right, and the main dining area to the left. There\\'s also that karaoke machine I\\'ve never seen used in all the years I\\'ve gone here.\\n\\nUnlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren\\'t all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it\\'s all about the food, which is fine by me. I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it\\'s fun to look like a goofball while trying, but that\\'s neither here nor there.\\n\\nThe food here is excellent. They\\'ve introduced a new look to their menu recently. I don\\'t know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I\\'m not sure if they\\'re using it for anything other than just what\\'s on the main menu, which would be a shame if so, as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I\\'m not aware of.\\n\\nAt any rate, the starter soup and salad is great. I love the bits of onion in the soup. It\\'s a very strong broth, but not overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love it, but I tend to like it everywhere I\\'ve had it, so I\\'m not a real stickler when it comes to that.\\n\\nUsually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it\\'s a great dish. I\\'ve also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well.\\n\\nNow, my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the \"magic sauce.\" It\\'s of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I\\'m always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don\\'t have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn\\'t come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it\\'s a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.\\n\\nSo if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It\\'s amazing. Use it for your steak or chicken as well. I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli. I don\\'t care for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.\\n\\nSapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn\\'t have them as well. I think they were doing fine without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, if unnecessary.\\n\\nThe steak here is great. I\\'ve had the sirloin as well as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. All around, you get a great meal here for the price.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore. Sapporo\\'s a funny place in that some weeknights you\\'ll drive by and it\\'s packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I\\'d suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds. Yet even when it was \"packed\" I\\'ve never had to wait long to be seated at a table.\\n\\nSo if you haven\\'t been, give Sapporo a try. It\\'s been there forever. The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit. They don\\'t do lunches anymore, so it\\'s strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least 20-30 dollars on up for adults, and around 10 or so for kids\\' meals. It\\'s not some place you would go frequently if you\\'re on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go.',\n",
       " 357: 'Sammy\\'s. Shammy\\'s. Sambo\\'s. Slambo\\'s. Shlambo\\'s. Shammy, thank you for the shamshine. I could go on, but I\\'ll get on with the review. However, those are all the names I call my fave pizza joint in Pittsburgh.\\n\\n\"Hold up, J.\" I hear you saying. \"Didn\\'t you decree Sarafino\\'s as having the best pizza in Pittsburgh?\" I did..and Sammy\\'s is right up there with it. It\\'s different from Sarafino\\'s, but I love it just as much, so the kudos is going to have to be shared in this instance. So let\\'s get down to it.\\n\\nSammy\\'s is an inconspicuous joint in the Green Tree/Crafton dining area. It\\'s been there for a while and it has its share of local fans and families that frequent it regularly (along with our local boys in blue as well as the state police). The staff is friendly, the atmosphere low key, and everything I\\'ve tried on the menu is damned good. \\n\\nThe pizza is phenomenal. The sauce is on the sweeter side, with just the right amount of tang. The crust is soft and not too chewy, with the cheese to sauce to crust ratio practically perfect. Every time I have a first bite of a slice of Sammy\\'s pizza, my mind splits open, just like Lou Reed sings about on \"Sister Ray.\" It\\'s so good. Every element of the pie is tasty, with no one part overpowering any of the others. I like the pepperoni they use here. It\\'s the smaller disc type that curls up on the edges when it\\'s baked. And you can\\'t go wrong at all if you get meatballs as a topping here, either.\\n\\nMy other favorite thing here is the chicken wings. Now, I generally think Wings, Suds and Spuds up in Moon Township has the overall best wings in the Pittsburgh area, but they can be a tad expensive. Sammy\\'s fries their wings as well, and come really close to being a mirror of Wings, Suds and Spuds. They\\'re also about four dollars cheaper per order. I love the buffalo bleu, buffalo ranch, and parmesan bbq sauces. They have a ton of other flavors, as well as some not regularly listed on their weekly wing night specials.\\n\\nSo what else is good here? The chicken parm sandwich is perfect, I\\'ve not had a better one anywhere. The steak hoagie is also excellent. The nachos are super, if you just get them with cheese only, or one of the bigger versions with meat and other toppings. Onion rings? Crazy tasty. Mozzarella sticks? Gooey and groovy ust like they should be.\\n\\nThere\\'s also plenty of salads, soups, pasta dishes, fish sandwiches, etc. Everything I\\'ve had here I\\'ve enjoyed. I go to Sammy\\'s at least once every week and I never feel like I\\'m tired of it. It\\'s just that good. The prices are in that sweet spot as well, so compared to some of the other pizza and Italian places around, you do get great value for your money here.\\n\\nIt is a smaller establishment, but looks can be deceiving. The parking lot isn\\'t big, but even when it looks crowded, there\\'s often plenty of spots to sit at inside. So don\\'t let a few cars dissuade you from coming in. A good restaurant wants lots of customers, after all. \\n\\nFor the beer drinkers out there, Sammy\\'s does sell brew, though there is no bar. They do have a good selection of favorite, expected domestics as well as some indie brews. \\n\\nThey do a bang up business on the weekend, and deliver only on Friday and Saturday. If you live in the area, you may want to just call in and pick up your order as it\\'s often quicker to do so by 30 minutes. No slight against their delivery, but since it\\'s not an establishment that mainly focuses on that aspect, the takeout is a great way to go. A lot of times the parking lot is filled mainly with people just running in to pick up their orders.\\n\\nSo if you love pizza, Sammy\\'s is the place to go, along with Sarafino\\'s. If you\\'re looking for the usual sorts of things local pizza places offer aside from pizza, then you definitely want to go to Sammy\\'s. It\\'s light years better than Portofino\\'s, Mario\\'s, etc. You can tell the staff cares about what they\\'re making and serving to its patrons as the food is always top notch. \\'Nuff said.',\n",
       " 358: 'Never have I seen a place go from a favorite of mine in the city to some place I\\'ll never go again so fast. \\n\\nI started going to Southside Steaks shortly after it opened. I thought the steak sandwiches were amazing and rivaled the best Philly had to offer. I\\'d sing their praises to anyone who was remotely interested in eating cheesesteaks. Not only was the food great, but the design of the restaurant was funky and fit perfectly in the busy Carson Street neighborhood of the South Side. They did cheesesteaks and great fries and not a whole lot else.\\n\\nOver the years, things pretty much remained the same. Every now and then a special new sandwich would be introduced to the menu. Maybe it would stick around, maybe it was just their briefly. All was good and well. Unfortunately, I had to move away from beloved Pittsburgh for a few years (to Philly of all places, which gave me an even better barometer of what to expect from a cheesesteak after exploring numerous outlets in that city), but upon my return I was pleased to see Southside Steaks was still up and running and just as good as I had remembered, albeit with a couple menu changes like chicken wings being prominently pushed.\\n\\nSInce my return, I haven\\'t been as much as a regular as I once was, so I wasn\\'t aware of the whole rebranding to \"The Groove\" until I saw a recent post on Facebook mentioning it. So I decided to stop in last week and see what was what. I shouldn\\'t have bothered. The menu is a godawful mess now, with everything being sold in combos, which you can either choose by a preselected list of sandwiches or a build your own deal. Sorry, but even in my dark days in Philly I was never once asked if I wanted my sandwich toasted. You don\\'t toast cheesesteaks. But that was the first option displayed when picking out a combo.\\n\\nThen there was the place on the list asking what sort of seasoning you want on your sandwich. What do you mean, what kind of seasoning do I want on my cheesesteak? None! Who does this? No one else, to my knowledge. Not even the crappiest cheesesteak joints (and there are plenty in Philly) ask you what kind of seasoning you want on your sandwich. It was just weird.\\n\\nSo the combos are listed at $9.75 and come with chips (this for the build your own deal). For an extra dollar, you can get fries included. Gimme a break. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the old method here. An affordable and tasty cheesesteak and a huge order of fries if you wanted em separately, with either cheese whiz or gravy for a little extra. But I added the fries because they used to be great. Now, it seems like they\\'re trying to mimic Wingstop\\'s fries with the seasoning. At Wingstop, that\\'s fine. This is how their fries have always been and it\\'s part of *their* menu. Southside Steak\\'s fries used to be awesome, but in this case they had so much fry seasoning dumped on them it was ridiculous. Not even Wingstop dumps that much on. Blech. What a disappointment.\\n\\nI just got a basic Philly cheesesteak as usual with whiz and grilled onions. Nothing fancy. The meat, which was once really juicy and tasty before was now dry and dull. The roll it was on was chewy and tasteless. What the hell happened? You don\\'t take once worked so completely well and upend it all in one fell swoop and change everything. It absolutely sucks. We asked if the place had changed owners and were told by the cashier that it hadn\\'t and the new menu reflected the \"better quality of the food.\" OK, so going from pretty damn great in my opinion to absolute Sucktown doesn\\'t seem to bear that statement out in the least.\\n\\nAnd the interior. What the hell? Southside Steaks had its own slightly gritty, personal charm. Now it looks like an effing tube sock came in and exploded all over the walls with a stupid stripe pattern. The high tables are gone, being replaced with generic mall food court type tables and chairs. And all the stupid \\'80s crap. Hey, I lived and liked the \\'80s, but it makes absolutely no sense. And \"The Groove\" is an absolutely stupid name. What about that suggests cheesesteaks, other than it has \"Cheesesteak Co.\" tagged onto the end of it? Terrible name.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t be surprised to see The Groove become a Carson Street casualty in a short amount of time. Nothing was wrong with Southside Steaks. Everything is wrong with The Groove. The prices are crap, the menu is terrible, the food is subpar, and the decor is just dumb. I haven\\'t been this disappointed in an eatery in quite a while. Why did you guys screw this up so incredibly bad? I\\'m never going back, and I suggest you stay away as well.',\n",
       " 359: \"Ah, back in Pittsburgh after seven years. Actually, I've been back for a few months, but hey, I had to hit all my fave spots again before I could start cranking out the reviews. You understand.\\n\\nAnyway, what I really want you to know is that Sarafino's is my favorite Italian restaurant, period. They're just as excellent now as they were before I moved. Not that I was worried they'd change, but it's good to know that this place has stuck to its menu and terrific daily specials.\\n\\nSarafino's is small and cozy, and as cliched as it might sound, it feels like family. The staff are always friendly and inviting, the owner a great guy who cares about his establishment. It's always seemed like a hidden gem tucked away in Crafton, and maybe that's the best thing about it. There are a ton of Italian restaurants around Pittsburgh, and Sarafino's is in a league of its own, off the beaten path.\\n\\nSo what's great here? Everything I've tried. The bread that is brought to the table has the best dipping oil I've ever had. It's sweeter than other places, and one could be forgiven for filling himself up on the bread alone. But that's just for starters. The famous greens and beans are just the thing if you're looking for something on the spicier side, and the wedding soup and pasta fagioli are fantastic.\\n\\nMy favorite thing on the menu, though, is the gnocchi. I've never had better. It literally melts in your mouth, which is what a great gnocchi should do. It's never chewy, never tough. I always get mine in the roasted red pepper sauce (there are plenty of other sauces to choose from; they're all tasty) with meatballs. And man, I love Sarafino's meatballs. They're one of a kind, milder than others, but perfectly complement the dish, while also soaking up the flavor of the main entree.\\n\\nThe seared steak panini and grilled steak salad are also must-haves. And the pizza? My fave in the 'burgh! A nice, thin crispy crust with a sweet sauce base and delicious toppings of your choice. Then there are the daily specials. The crab cakes with portobella mushroom on the side are amazing. Nothing but crab meat, no filler! And if they have the lasagna, you cannot miss out on that. It will split your mind open in a revelatory fashion, I kid you not. Then there's the veal parm, the ravioli...you get the idea.\\n\\nSo for those of you who actually favor joints like The Olive Garden or Bucca di Beppo, knock it off. This is the real deal. Of course, those of us in the know don't mind keeping Sarafino's all to ourselves. But you'd be missing out on one of the best if you didn't stop by.\",\n",
       " 360: \"It's a Pittsburgh institution. You know it by heart. Fries and slaw on all the sandwiches. The locals love it. It's revered nationwide. Perhaps even larger than that. But I can't say I've ever been supremely bowled over by the food at any of the locations.\\n\\nI think first and foremost for me it's the slaw. Hey, I love cole slaw, be it sweet or otherwise. But Primanti's slaw just seems to overpower everything else on their sandwiches, including the fries, which do their own thing trying to battle it out for top taste when mashed in with everything else you have going on between two slices of bread.\\n\\nAnd, like another reviewer said, the Pittsburgher is just not very good at all due to the mushy, salisbury steak-like quality of the meat. There are a couple other local places around here that use the same kind of meat (Portofino's comes to mind with their hamburger hoagie), and I can't figure out why. Why go this route when you could just use good old ground beef or chuck, fry up a patty and cut it in half? It's bordering on meatloaf here, but meatloaf that's trying to taste like a burger and it's just weird.\\n\\nOther sandwiches I've had here such as the jumbo and cheese fare better. Finding a sandwich that suits your tastebuds might take a few attempts to nailing down the right one. Although, there are plenty here who enjoy it right out of the gate and swear by it. Sometimes hype does indeed work.\\n\\nThe next time I visit, I plan on trying the chicken wings, which is a relatively new thing on the menu. I hear they're really good, and I'm a sucker for tasty wings. All in all, Primanti Brothers is a place you'll either love or wind up scratching your head at, wondering what all the fuss is about. I love Pittsburgh and its endless enjoyable food options. I just always feel like I should love Primanti's more since everyone else does.\",\n",
       " 361: 'When Pizza Palermo first moved in to the old KFC location, I was skeptical. With a slogan like \"Its X-Traordinary!\" I wasn\\'t very hopeful. The fact that their takeout special of a large pizza with one topping went up a buck within the first couple of weeks wasn\\'t exactly a confidence booster, either. But, as things will happen, I finally got curious enough to give it a shot a few months after its initial opening.\\n\\nI have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with the pizza here. The sauce is a little on the sweeter side, the cheese is just greasy enough, and the dough isn\\'t overly chewy. The pies I\\'ve had with pepperoni have been quite good, and the Italian sausage that Palermo\\'s uses is mildly spicy, which I found to be a nice surprise. I also like the little cup of ranch dressing you get with every pizza. It complements the taste of the slices nicely.\\n\\nThe breadsticks are also quite good with just enough of a garlic dusting and not overly greasy. However, the rest of the stuff I have had at Pizza Palermo is just mediocre. The chicken wings are nothing to get excited about. They taste exactly like you would imagine them to. Kind of gummy (they\\'re not fried here) with too much sauce dumped on top (a little BBQ sauce goes a long way, guys) and a bit of stretchy skin. Meh.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are hit and miss as well. The first time I had the steak and ranch hoagie, it was rather tasty. The second time there wasn\\'t as much meat and not enough dressing on it, so it was rather dry. The chicken parm hoagie was a complete miss. It\\'s made with chicken tenders, most of the ones which wound up on mine were rubbery and had way too much gristle on them. Pass.\\n\\nThe staff here is friendly, and whether I\\'ve ordered by phone or line, the quoted time to pick it up given to me was always correct. This is usually an average of 20 minutes. In fact, every time I\\'ve gone in to pick up my order, it was ready before I even got there, so I will say that these guys are efficient at cranking out ordes for pickup. I haven\\'t tried delivery, so I can\\'t comment on that.\\n\\nThere are some tables at this location, but it doesn\\'t really feel like a place you\\'d want to eat in, just as much as the old KFC there was mainly about takeout. It is nice and clean though, probably more so than when it was a KFC, so if you do decide to eat here, you don\\'t have to worry about crummy tables, sticky floors and the like.\\n\\nSo pizza and breadsticks = good, and everything else = done better elsewhere. I do like how close this location is to my apartment, but then I\\'m kind of in the center of everything in Crafton, so location is never much of something to complain about for me. But if you\\'re looking for pretty tasty pizza, Pizza Palermo is good, so give it a shot.',\n",

Just a bar maybe 15-20 people drinking at the bar, a couple lounge tables near the bar- the inside was huge it seemed like a club venue, but it was only 730- no club is really in operation at 730- so after we were interrogated/questioned by a Butch lady who was convinced we showed up for her birthday and felt the right to ask each of us what our current relationship status was... we thought it was a private party.\\n\\nNo one has kicked us out yet and we were all really hungry, so we decided to venture deeper into the building where we saw it open up into a second, event larger room with 2 bars.

Some of the reviews elsewhere scared me, but I decided to rely on my memory instead and pay another visit. I'm glad I did, because it's pretty much exactly the same as I remembered.\\n\\nI called ahead at lunchtime because I didn't have long and needed to grab and go. The gentleman who answered the phone was polite, made conversation with me, and said my order would be ready in ten minutes. And indeed it was -- it's a big downer when places give inaccurate times. (Downtown, Fadz has great sandwiches but always add at least 10 minutes to the time they quote you.) I waited behind the folks placing orders there -- I didn't look to see if there was a separate pickup area, but I don't think there is -- but that only took a couple minutes.\\n\\nI got a mushroom steak with Cheez Whiz (duh) and an order of gravy fries. I like gravy on my fries, OK?  The bread they use is perfect for cheesesteaks; it's a little chewy but not hard. The meat itself is good quality, not all gristly and gross. The veggies are a bit meh. I suspect the mushrooms of being canned, and I wish the grilled onions had been a little more plentiful and tender. I'll just ask for more next time. \\n\\nThe fries are good, of the hand cut variety and cooked just a bit brown. There's enough salt to make them tasty. For my personal taste, I wish they were a little soggier, but that's just me. If you like your fries on the crispy side, they're perfect. The gravy came on the side (much easier for taking back to your desk and eating) and is, you know, brown gravy that you put on fries.\\n\\nI'd classify my lunch as good, but not great, overall. However, the fact that I REALLY wanted a cheesesteak bumped my enjoyment level up considerably. Southside Steaks makes good sandwiches.\\n\\nSince this was my first visit in a long time, I can't speak to their other menu options, but I can say I'll definitely be going back. Prices feel reasonable to me; $10 puts it out of my everyday lunch options but keeps it within range for things I deem special occasions (e.g. Thursdays). They do have a $10 minimum for credit cards.\",\n",

Very convenient if you work in the Steel Building; it's just a short walk down the alley.\\n\\nThey use Mancini bread, which means awesome in my book. Great flavor to the bread itself, which is made with adequate salt; slightly dry; all the better to absorb the grease and sauce from your sandwich. The Ragin' Cajun hoagie is amazing. Only a little bit spicy, and half of it will get you through an entire day. The chicken is thinly sliced breast meat and fried like cheesesteak-steak, with a good degree of browning involved. The only thing that bugs me is the shredded lettuce and mealy tomatoes, which have no place on this type of hoagie anyway. Pet peeve, right? I ask for it with onion only.\\n\\nI also love eggs on sandwiches, so the Steeler is pretty great, too. I prefer Southside Steaks for cheesesteak, on the whole, but if you're stuck downtown with a half-hour lunch, that's not an option.\\n\\nThe only sandwich I've had here and haven't liked was the Big Melt, aka their tuna. Now, I. Love. Tuna. but this was pretty meh. Plain tuna -- no celery lurking therein, thank God -- but it needed something. If dill pickles were involved, it could be good. As is, I just wouldn't bother; the work cafeteria offered edible fried fish sammiches on Fridays, so.\\n\\nThe fries seem to be fresh made, if slightly overcooked and soggy. They're better on the sandwiches as a condiment, sez the Pittsburgh native, than they are as a side in their own right. I'm not sure they fry them properly (once in cooler oil, once in hot) because they're fairly brown and greasy. Still much tastier than, say, BK fries or something; they actually taste like potatoes. If you have enough time, get your sandwich here and your fries at Wiener World across the street.\\n\\nWeirdly, they do offer delivery, just not during lunch hours, and they're barely open outside of those -- so if you're good getting your sandwich at 10:30 in the morning and letting it sit for a while, you can take advantage. Otherwise, just go pick up. If you've called in an order, don't wait in line; skip up to the right side of the counter and let them know.\\n\\nPro tip: CALL AHEAD. If you're on a half hour lunch, you'll end up late back if you don't. They do work quickly but are packed and I've waited fifteen minutes for food.\\n\\nThey do run daily specials, so check those out for a good deal. The hoagies are all in the $7 range, which ain't bad for dahntahn.\\n\\nThe whole place is black and gold; jerseys and sports photos on the walls. It's about the size of an average Subway restaurant. They do have tables, and since most folks are going for take-out at lunch, seats are generally available. They have three bar stools at the back right for those waiting for their order, next to the coolers and condiments, so it can be a bit of a logjam.

(They're less than a block apart in the South Side, by the way.)\\n\\nI elected to get a ribeye gyro, since proper gyro meat isn't always my favorite. I know; shoot me. Some days I love it, some days I just want the tzatziki and tomatoes with some kind of charred meat flavor underneath. And that's exactly what I got. The friendly woman at the counter grilled up two thin ribeye steaks and slapped them on a piece of fluffy pita with lettuce, tomato, onion, and tons of tzatziki. Tons. Enough for me, and I'm a sauce addict. (Aside: Why is it so difficult to buy the pocketless fluffy pita at the supermarket?) I could have eaten two of the gyros, but my appetite is a little out of control lately, so I'd say one plus fries is good for the average bear.\\n\\nThere wasn't a combo deal with the ribeye gyro (there is for both chicken and... gyro gyro), but I added an order of fries and was glad I did. These are fresh cut, and properly salted. I think they'd already been fried once and were re-dropped to finish (proper fries should be cooked twice). Not quite of the same caliber as, say, Patch fries, or even Five Guys, but for something I can grab on my lunch break? They're about the same as Southside Steaks' fries, for me.\\n\\nTook about five minutes to get my order, since it was made to order, and I was the only person there at 11am. Not bad.

Absolutely top notch.\\n\\nGyro and Chicken Gyro - 4/5 - Tasty, and the gyro meat had good flavor. Their tzatziki is pretty great as well, I just wish there were more of it (this is always true, though). The chicken was actually grilled, and tasted like actual chicken that had been actually grilled, as opposed to \"we put a bunch of black pepper on this so you might think it was grilled har har.\" Sadly the pita was somehow a little dried out around the edges, and the greens were a little sad, but that was probably just a one-day kind of thing.\\n\\nFries - 2/5 - eh, they\\'re fries. Steak fries. You know.\\n\\nMixed Grill Platter - 5/5 - Seriously, the fact that I can get this delivered to my house makes me swoon a little. You get two kinds of kofte, grilled chicken and grilled lamb, all of which were delicious and not overcooked. The spicy kofte in particular was kind of amazing. Now, what they didn\\'t say on the menu was that this is all served on some pizza dough with black and white sesame seeds, which is somehow one of the most delicious things I\\'ve ever eaten. Also, fries, but they\\'re unremarkable in context.\\n\\nHummus - 4/5 - not bad at all, served with one pita, and with a healthy amount of garlic.\\n\\nBabaghannoush - 3/5 - a little slimy, as babaghannoush sometimes can be, but quite tasty all the same.\\n\\nBaklava - 3.5/5 - A little bit unsubtle, and I don\\'t love the walnut version, but the pistachio is pretty excellent.',\n",

We shared a hibachi shrimp lunch (at $9.95, a bit overpriced for seven shrimp, a huuuuge portion of fried rice, a small side of hibachi veg, and soup) as well as salmon teriyaki. The shrimp, again, were pleasing for Pittsburgh shrimp. The salmon was again dry, but the teriyaki flavor was excellent and I loved the inclusion of grilled onions. The shumai are passable; I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to order them again. However, the simple steamed rice was fantastic. Not sticky, not hard, each grain separate = perfect. \\n\\nI haven\\'t eaten their sushi; a California roll was included with our lunch delivery but I was way too full to even think about it. Maybe someday.\\n\\nIt\\'s sort of the Japanese restaurant equivalent of the Cheesecake Factory, with a huge and varied menu and debatable \"authenticity\" (whatever that\\'s worth), and most items of middling to good quality. Nothing achieves gourmet greatness, but it\\'s not really meant to.',\n",

I don\\'t really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn\\'t deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. \\n\\nThe drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. \\n\\nOverall, embarrassing.

       " 394: \"The main reasons to go to Buffalo Blues would be for their All You Can Eat Ribs night every Tuesday for $21 and their All You Can Eat Wings night every Wednesday for $9.  Make sure you go with a bunch of guys, because it isn't all you care to eat, it is a challenge.  You have to eat all you can eat and your ego is on the line if you don't.  I once went to Ribs night and one buddy of mine ordered a Buffalo Chicken salad when everyone else ordered ribs.  Yea, he regretted his terrible decision.\\n\\nAnyways.  The food itself.  The ribs are basic baby back ribs that come in a choice of mild, medium, and hot bbq sauce.  I tend to just go medium, b/c I find a hot bbq sauce covers up the taste of the meat itself, and when I eat ribs I care more about the taste and texture of the actual meat with the sauce being a supporting player.  The ribs are ok for mass produced ribs, nothing spectacular.  The most I've done is only two racks of ribs, but that was only because I didn't want to keep everyone else waiting up for me.  Ribs come in a rack in first round, and then re-orders come by the half rack.\\n\\nPersonally I prefer wing night, as they have fantastic wings.  Wings come in a dozen in the first round, followed by half dozen reorders until you're done.  They have 12 different flavors, but my favorite ones are Buffalo Blue, Old Yeller, and Red Hot Parm.  Buffalo Blue is a tasty bbq sauce that isn't overly sweet like some of their other bbq sauces, Old Yeller is a Carolina Mustard based sauce, and Red Hot Parm is a traditional Buffalo sauce (Frank's Red Hot + Butter) then topped with Parmesan Cheese.  Their Cool Ranch, Garlic Parm, and Spicy Garlic can be a bit greasy, so if you do order one of those make sure its in a batch of 6 and you share with your friends, I kind of like their Spicy Garlic, but no one else ever wants to split an order with me, oh well.  Their Gold Rush and Death Row are their two other non-spicy bbq sauces, but I prefer Buffalo Blue to both of them.\\n\\nFor their spicy flavors, there's Red Hot, which is just a traditional Buffalo, there's Howlin' Wolf, which is a spicy sour sauce with pepper seeds on it, and there's Hotter than Hell, which is a spicy bbq sauce.  Personally I find Howlin' Wolf tasty in small quantities, but sometimes the sourness gets to me.  I tend to find spicy bbq sauces a bit funky, so I'm not big on Hotter than Hell.\\n\\nIf I have a big appetite I eat from 24-30 wings.  If its just a regular day I'll eat around 18-22ish wings.\\n\\nNote: These wings are huge.  They aren't your typical Wingzone or Quaker Steak and Lube sized wings.  These are real wings from real chickens, not some little baby chicks just hatched from their eggs.\\n\\nThe rest of the menu is just typical American restaurant food with various sandwiches, a burger option, salad options, etc.\\n\\nHighly highly recommended.\",\n",
       " 395: '3.5 stars.  I was brought in by the claims of how large the \"RoethlisBurger\" is by vendors and other shoppers in the Strip District and I had to see it in person.  \\n\\nPeppi\\'s has a dive-y sort of place but in a good way.  The flat top grill is behind the counter in the front and the back of Peppi\\'s has a couple tables and booths with Steelers paraphernalia on the walls.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t too hungry so I ended up ordering \"The Phantom\", which was a cheese steak with grilled mushrooms, onions, and a fried egg.  My companions got a mushroom cheese steak and the famed #7, the \"RoethlisBurger\" itself.  All the sandwiches come with the basic fixin\\'s of lettuce tomato, etc. and are a foot long.\\n\\nThe Phantom was a little smaller than I expected, but the flavors of the ingredients in the sandwich melded together wonderfully.  My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more meat.  After some searching online, apparently all their steak subs only have a quarter pound of steak.\\n\\nFor some reason based on the picture of the RoethlisBurger in the window outside we thought it was going to be a lot bigger.  I guess camera angles can be deceiving.  It\\'s a mix of chopped burger and sausage with American cheese and a fried egg.\\n\\nOverall I would have liked it a bit more if the sandwiches were served a bit faster (some people who ordered after us got their food first) and a bit more meat.\\n\\nAnyways, I\\'m definitely going to be back to try the RoethlisBurger since now I view it as a potentially tasty sandwich as opposed to just a ridiculously impossible food challenge.',\n",
       " 396: 'Tessaro\\'s was both a passing point and my final destination on my hamburger road trip across America.  I\\'ve had famous burgers such as the ones at Mr. Bartley\\'s up in MA or the french bread burgers down at Rotier\\'s in Nashville as well as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.\\n\\nAfter it all, I still see Tessaro\\'s as one of the best burgers I\\'ve had ever (my other top burger joints are scattered throughout the midwest where the beef is as fresh as fresh gets).  I started out with medium rare burgers when I first started going there, but eventually I toned down the knob to rare.  My cheese choice is always a slice of American.\\n\\nI typically like my burgers griddled with only burger bun and cheese, but since Tessaro\\'s serves up \"Pub Burgers\", I find it okay to eat with rabbit food (lettuce, tomato, onion).  Ketchup on a burger is blasphemy.  There is never a reason to add ketchup on a burger unless the burger is of poor quality.  Ketchup on a good burger is like heading to a prime steakhouse and asking for A1.  Save it for when you overcook your burgers at home or when you\\'re at McDonald\\'s.  Mustard is okay in reasonable quantities since its texture and taste complements the burger as opposed to covering it up.\\n\\nMy first thought was wow. These buns are huge. The top bun was awkwardly round and I had squish it a little to get a first bite that consisted of both burger and bun. It worked out in the end, as the buns were able to sop up all the excess beef juice without getting excessively soggy and difficult to hold. The patty itself was perfectly cooked. A full half pound of loosely packed coarse ground beef. I\\'m not sure what blend they use (definitely more than just chuck), but I want to guess around 75-80% lean, which is perfect in my book. The beef itself had an amazing texture and wasn\\'t heavily seasoned. The beef itself tasted remarkably fresh and just the right amount of \"beefy\". I usually order cheeseburgers over hamburgers as the slice of cheese makes the burger more forgiving to being overcooked and dry; however, at Tessaro\\'s, this was not the case. The slice of American cheese was perfectly melted and added the textural difference between the soft buns, the crisp lettuce, and the beefy patty. The lettuce and onions added additional contrast with their crunchy attributes, and the acidity from the two tomato slices balanced out the cheese. The soggy pickles were overshadowed by the red onion slices which offered not only a crunch but also a spicy kick, and I did not notice them at all.\\n\\nMy side choice is always home fries.  They come slightly charred and taste of delicious butter.  I had half my portion \"naked\" and paired the half with the traditional Heinz ketchup. Honestly they didn\\'t need the extra boost of flavor from the ketchup as they were amazing beforehand already. With the addition of the Heinz, the subtle tones of the char and butter were covered up, which was a pity.\\n\\nWhen you go to a steakhouse you order a steak.  When you go to a coffeehouse you order a coffee.  When you go to Tessaro\\'s you order a burger.',\n",
       " 397: 'Overrated.  Completely overrated.\\n\\nAfter reading all the rave reviews and hearing about how amazing SOBA was, I went there last night with two companions.  We started off with an order of calamari and tuna tartar.  What came out even before our appetizers was a complementary cucumber salad (it appeared that every table got it).  I found the flavor of the cucumber salad the best part of dinner.  The cool cucumbers were complemented with a slightly spicy sauce, which were served with slices of pita bread.  Even though our waiter went on about how the calamari was different than other restaurants, it was strikingly similar to the overly breaded calamari at the Cheesecake Factory.  It wasn\\'t heavily seasoned, and most of the flavor came from the garlic sauce and freshly squeezed lime juice.  I preferred the tuna tartar over the calamari, as the the flavors melded well together with just the right amount of bite from citrus notes.  These were served with house made potato chips, which were sliced thin and fried golden with just the right amount of crunch.\\n\\nFor entrees, my companions ordered our server\\'s #1 and #2 recommendations of seared rare tuna and boneless pork chop, and I ordered the wok seared sea scallops, since I\\'ve been having a craving for large plump sea scallops for some time.  One companion asked a rhetorical question of why everything that is labeled as \"Asian fusion\" or \"exotic\" has to be spicy, which we could not answer.  His seared rare tuna was a tuna steak cooked rare topped with the Korean \"gochujang\" mellowed out with some soy and probably sugar (that\\'s where the fusion plays in, instead of kiwi or pear juice).  He mentioned that he liked the ginger fried rice, even though the rice was probably one day old (fried rice is traditionally made with leftover rice).  My other companion received a 10 oz. thick cut pork chop.  Being so thick and also pork, the meat was flavorless and dry.  I sampled a piece from the outside edge and one cut from the center; the first piece had the flavor form the char, but the center cut one was so bland I could not finish it.  The defining part of the dish was it\\'s spicy chili honey sauce, as it made the pork edible.  The grits were OK, not amazing, but not bad.  Two five oz. pork chops would\\'ve probably done the dish more justice than that 10 oz monstrosity.  Meats that need to be cooked through should not be thick cut unless it\\'s well marbled, and we all know how hard it is to find marbled pork nowadays.  Last, my dish consisted of around 4 oz. of rice cakes cooked in an overly salty \"sauce\" with pork and bok choy topped with four seared sea scallops.  For some reason, I was expecting my sea scallops to be around 30% larger in diameter, but realistically being in Pittsburgh the only scallops that are available are ones that are shipped from the coast.  The scallops were seared perfectly (but honestly now, searing sea scallops is not difficult).  The rice cakes were cooked properly, but they were miniscule in size and thickness, and overly salty from the \"spicy\" sauce, which had maybe quarter of a clove of minced garlic, and half a seeded chili pepper.  The bok choy was cooked beyond recognition, and basically became a sponge for the soy sauce.  The few strips of julienned pork was probably 2 oz. meat, and did not fit well with the dish as it got lost in the sauce.  DISHES THAT ARE SOUPY IN NATURE SHOULD HAVE LARGER PIECES OF MEAT; ONLY DISHES THAT HAVE MORE SOLID FOOD THAN LIQUID SHOULD BE ALLOWS TO USE SMALL PIECES OF MEAT.  I was not impressed at all.  Yes, I keep switching between soup and sauce; it\\'s labeled as a sauce in the menu, and it was definitely too salty to be a soup, but it\\'s consistency was that of soup, and it was served with one of those soup spoons you get with egg drop soup in Asian restaurants.\\n\\nFor it\\'s price, SOBA should\\'ve been much better.  I would\\'ve given SOBA two stars, but our waiter was attentive and the ambiance was nice.',\n",
       " 398: \"Girasole is a small Italian restaurant off Walnut Street that serves up decent Italian food.  I've only been to Girasole during dinnertime, with my last visit being last night.  Most patrons appear to be late 20's/early 30's to older patrons in the late 40's/early 50's as well as some college students here and there.  The restaurant itself is pretty cramped and ridiculously loud.  Tables are close together and patrons are all basically shouting to talk to each other or awkwardly sitting in silence.  I'm a loud guy who's at college and loud noises typically don't bother me, but something about the acoustics of the room... noises just bounce around instead of getting absorbed and the metal tables don't help either.  Anyways, on with the food.\\n\\nTheir menu is seasonal with slight changes in their pasta throughout the year.  Everyday they have a fresh poultry, a fresh fish, and a fresh meat of the day.  Their fresh fish was a grilled mako shark, but alas they were out for the night already (we got there before 6:30 PM).  All entrees come with a choice of soup or salad.  I ended up ordering their house ribeye medium rare along with a cup of their wedding soup.\\n\\nWhile we waited, we munched on bread from their bread basket.  Butter comes with the bread, but they also have balsamic and olive oil at each table too.\\n\\nThe wedding soup was pretty good; it wasn't overly salty and there was a reasonably amount of sausage.  I picked soup over their salad because my past experience with their salads are that they are swimming in dressing and I don't like my salads soggy.\\n\\nThe ribeye came topped with a pesto, diced tomatoes and served with roasted potatoes.  It was cooked to medium as opposed to medium rare, but for a steak under $30 bucks I'm not going to make a big deal out of it.  The pesto was flavorful but the roasted potatoes were a bit overcooked.  The steak itself had a beautiful char and cooked well as a medium steak.\\n\\nI've had their pasta in the past and they're of pretty good quality and cooked perfectly, but the portions have gotten smaller over time and I don't think the $3-5 dollar upcharge from the lunch menu is really worth it for dinner anymore.\\n\\nI would probably recommend Lydia's over Girasole, but it might be worth a shot for lunch when it won't be as loud and there probably wouldn't be a wait either.\",\n",

Yes it was a bit unexpected, but it meant we got the full attention of the waitress and we could be seated anywhere we liked.  While we looked over the menu, she brought out a bread plate with a white bean dip drizzled with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and topped with red peppers.  The dip was delicious and we had no problem finishing everything.  Later she brought out three freshly made bowls of seafood chowder, compliments of the chef.  She noted with a laugh, \"one the perks of being the only customers right now.\"  The seafood chowder was chock-full of fish, scallops, mussels, and shrimp.  The base of the soup itself was flavorful and light, not like traditional chowders bogged down with heavy cream.  My two companions decided to start out with two more cups of the seafood chowder while I opted for their Capon and Ditalini soup, a chicken noodle soup offered every day.  My soup is freshly prepared with their house chicken stock with wilted spinach and topped with cheese.  I preferred the seafood chowder, but I have to note that the chicken stock had multiple layers and many subtle flavors.\\n\\nFor our entrees I ordered their gnocci, and my companions ordered their crab cakes and their flank steak.  My gnocci is advertised as \"house made\", but realistically it was brought in from elsewhere.  It was served with braised lamb in a tomato ragout and topped fish fresh basil and freshly grated cheese.  The flavors were all there, but I like my gnocci with a bit more of a bite to it.  The braised lamb was a bit tough and ended up detracting from the dish as opposed to improving it.  The crab cakes were pretty good, but would\\'ve been slightly more epic if the lump meat was a bit larger.  It\\'s a pretty small portion, so do make sure you order a soup to go along with it.  The flank steak was served medium rare topped with a horseradish creme fraiche with smashed potatoes.  The steak was excellent; cooked well and flavorful from being marinated and seasoned properly.  The smashed potatoes were a bit too cheesy for my liking, but I like how smashed potatoes have lots of textures going on with mild lumps of potato and potato skin in the mix.\\n\\nSausalido is BYOB, so you can bring your own bottle and you definitely should ($2 corkage fee per person).  Lots of entrees from the lunch menu have encore presentations on the dinner menu; however, there are new dishes as well such as a duck breast, scallops, and a pork chop.\\n\\nThere aren\\'t too many seats in the restaurant, so for dinner I\\'d recommend calling ahead for reservations just to be on the safe side.',\n",

Both our steaks were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. For our sides, we shared asparagus and a loaded baked potato. \\n\\nWe could not pass on dessert. I had to have Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake and BJ had the Key Lime Pie. The chocolate cake was amazing, I love it. So did BJ.  He ate it instead of his pie.  We got the pie to go and it was also very, very good. \\n\\nGreat place for a special occasion. We had a wonderful evening.\",\n",
       " 427: 'We dined here on Father\\'s Day. Surprisingly, a lot of others were also treating the \"Dad\" in their life to a legendary steak. I had requested a romantic booth not knowing that they didn\\'t have such a thing. But we did get a small table stuck in the corner. While you don\\'t seem to get a lot of privacy, you do get good service and a pretty decent meal. \\n\\nWe started with a with a Crabtini to share. It\\'s lump crab meat tossed in vinaigrette and served with Creole remoulade sauce in a chilled martini glass. Very yummy! \\n\\nAs for our steaks, they were amazing. I had a filet mignon. It was very flavorable and cooked to perfection. This is one of the best steaks that I have ever had. For our sides, we shared a one pound baked potato and asparagus with hollandise. For dessert, we shared a cr\\xc3\\xa8me br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e with fresh berries. Very delicious. Definitely a very nice special occasion restaurant.',\n",
       " 428: \"Huh.  Dang.  Darn it.  Shoot.  I was really looking forward to lunch here.  Parking at this location is beyond ridiculous, no, I didn't valet cause I wanted to shop after wards.  But who cares?  I was here for a great meal!  Things started off well, great folks at the hostess desk.  Attractive interior, beautiful dark rich woods, attractive lighting, dark plantation blinds, very nice table.  My server Paula was extremely nice and had the cutest accent.  I liked a lot of the choices on the menu, but on an impulse, decided on the salad with filet medallions and onions straws.  The first bite of steak was extraordinary, perfectly cooked, wonderful seasonings and flavor.  Fresh pieces of asparagus in the salad was a nice surprise.  Then the shocker.  The next medallion was under cooked, the next was over cooked and the rest were grisley.  Needless to say, I could not eat it.  My server was very apologetic.  And then the manager immediately appeared as if he had been shot out of a canon.  He apologized profusely.  I was very understanding, I mean everyone has a bad day, right?   And of course he offered another dish, but I declined.  I mean, the mood was gone.  But then again, this is why I don't eat at home. The salad was taken off my check, as should be expected.  I did have dessert, hell yes, I was still hungry!  I got the hazelnut chocolate cake, which was totally awesome and even pretty to look at.  It was big enough to feed an army, don't know if it was a regular slice or if they were trying to make up for the salad.  So, a really mixed review.  I will try Capital Grill, again.  And I hope to have much better results.\",\n",
       " 429: 'We decided to go to The Melting Pot on Christmas Eve. We knew that the city would be like a ghost town which was pretty cool. \\n\\nWe were seating promptly for our 7:00 pm reservation. We got a romantic little corner booth. They have some interesting \"speciality\" drinks. I got a pomegranate Cosmo which was really good, BJ got his usual beer. We were kinda familiar with the menu, but needed our server\\'s help with selecting our fondues. We ordered off the \"Alpine Big Night Out\" special menu. Sure, the restaurant is a bit pricey, but we got a lot to eat. Our first course included different types of bread, veggies and apples for dipping. We each got a very delicious salad, BJ\\'s included Gruyere and fontina cheeses, hard-boiled eggs & honey roasted almonds with a yummy shallot vinaigrette. I got a California salad, with mixed baby greens, Roma tomatoes, walnuts, Gorgonzola and raspberry black walnut vinaigrette. Their salads were so, so good! At this point we were pretty much full! \\n\\nThen came our main course. We got a lobster tail, NY strip, bratwurst, filet mignon, marinated shrimp, chicken, ravioli\\'s and veggies. I\\'m not sure what type of cooking broth we got, but your server can tell you what goes best with what you are ordering. It was really a lot of fun cooking our little bites and my boyfriend took charge of cooking all our vegetables. I was kinda put off at first of the thought of steak being cooked in broth. I like my meat seared a bit. But believe me, it was delicious. We also enjoyed the different sauces. \\n\\nWe could not pass on dessert, we got the Flaming Turtle, which was milk chocolate and chopped pecans \"flamb\\xc3\\xa9ed\" at our table. We got strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, Rice Krispies treats, pound cake and brownies. Lot\\'s of fun!! \\n\\nAlso, thanks to yelper Angel for the heads up about their \"mailing list\". We visited their website and got a coupon that saved us $16 on our dinner, which was very nice. I\\'m a girl that like to think I got a deal!',\n",
       " 430: \"Roaring Fork, oh Roaring Fork.  How do I love thee?  Let me counts the ways....\\n\\n1.....  Okay, I guess I don't really love you.  But I do like you, okay? \\n\\nFirst off, what an interesting location.  I could have been killed getting in the parking lot.  I had a reservation for 8:30.  No, my table wasn't ready at 8:30.  I found that very interesting because there was no one waiting in the lobby.  And wouldn't you know, they seated me by the kitchen.  Okay, folks, I know how long your food was sitting there Friday night and it's not pretty.  Their staff is like a bunch of crazy lunatics, but that's okay.\\n\\nI opted for the Huckleberry Margarita, nice but nothing to write home about.  Doesn't begin to compare with Roy's signature drink, but that's for another review.\\n\\nThe bread basket was full of unhealthy little taste treats, I especially liked the bacon & cornmeal bombs and the buttermilk, bacon, artery cloggers.  Yum, yum, even better slathered in chipotle honey butter.  My salad was great, I opted for the wild greens disguised as the iceberg wedge.  I'm a red meat girl, so I had the 8 oz. center cut filet mignon.  Eight is too much for any girl, so I was unable to finish.  But I did order it medium and since it was barely medium rare, I did have to send it back.  Luckily, I was close to the kitchen, so the re-cook didn't take long.  The flavor of the meat wasn't really remarkable, but satisfactory.  The green chile Mac 'n' Cheese is a really great idea and something that I will try to duplicate at home.  If any of you yelpers have the recipe, I would be interested in it.  Now, I'm thinking that since I didn't finish my steak, my server deemed me not worthy of a dessert, it wasn't even offered!  But that's okay, I guess I didn't really need it.\\n\\nAll in all, pleasant, but nothing to write home about.\",\n",
       " 431: \"We went in for an early dinner on a cold and gloomy Saturday. We had reservations and were seated right away, the restaurant wasn't very busy. We were led to a long narrow table right next to a huge group. We rebelled and asked for a booth. The host staff pondered a bit and said well, we can give you a booth, but we will be needing it by 6:45. Yeah, right. We will hurry thru dinner to give your table back. Ha ha. Sure, I said. We took the booth. \\n\\nService was very attentive and warm and friendly. We both had salads. For dinner, B.J. selected the Lobster Mac N Cheese. We were both expecting very little evidence of lobster, but there was actually a good quantity. The pasta and the cheese sauce was very delicious. I love this dish! I opted for the Surf & Turf. They have since changed the menu, but my steak was a perfectly grilled filet mignon with a super yummy crab cake. \\n\\nFor dessert, we had the winter trio. It was a small portion of ginger cake and a huge creme brulee. Loved, loved, loved dessert. I love this restaurant.\",\n",

This restaurant is located accross the street from the ball park, so it was the perfect choice!\\n\\nValet service was fairly quick.  Also, since we were going to the game, we were advised that we could leave our car there.  Very nice.\\n\\nWe were greeted promptly by the host for our 5:30 pm reservation and lead to a huge, plush semi circle red velvet platform booth.  Very nice!  The restaurant interior is hip and modern, but also very formal with white tablecloths.  We had two servers, both very nice girls from Erie.  We dressed business casual, because we were going to a bb game.  Although, most diners were dressed more formally.\\n\\nWe noticed an \"Early Nights\" special on the menu.  Since we were not that hungry, it seemed to be perfect for us.   Our starters were the satisfactory lobster bisque and the famous iceberg lettuce wedge with the most amazing blue cheese dressing, bacon and candied pecans.  To die for!  BJ got the BBQ Pork Shank which was very tender and delicious.  I opted for the Twin Filet Mignon with Bearnaise sauce and crispy onion straws.  Our sides were the one pound Idaho baked potato and steamed aspargus Bearnaise. Everything was well prepared and delicious.  However, plan to bring an appetite.  We were unable to try any of the \"made in house\" desserts, which we were both really disappointed about. \\n\\nThe bar area looks really nice and we are going to try it in the near future. \\n\\nAlso, after the game, while we were waiting for our car, we saw one of the Steeler\\'s players.  Kinda fun, if you are into that sort of thing.  Our valet said that they come in all the time.',\n",
       " 433: \"Hyde Park continues to be our favorite stop before a baseball game.  So much nicer that trying to balance nachos in your lap or downing a hot dog while standing.\\n\\nWe had called ahead last night to reserve a plush booth in the bar area.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  Service, as always was fantastic.  We had our usual drinks, I enjoyed Cosmo and BJ downed bottles of nicely priced beers.\\n\\nSince I was pretending to eat light, I ordered the crab cakes appetizer.  Their crab cakes are decent, but it's what they are served with the makes them extra special.  Mine were served with a yummy red pepper aioli and some grainy mustard sauce with a sprig of broccoli rabe, a roasted red tomato and some delicious grated carrots.   Great combination of flavors.  BJ got the a French Dip from the Early Nights menu.  Sliced prime rib with horseradish sauce served on a hefty French roll with fries.  And it came with side and a choice of soup or salad.  He got the half Hyde Park Wedge which is a half of head of iceberg lettuce, tons of blue cheese dressing, with crispy bacon & candied pecans.  This is hands down, one of the best salads in the city.  We both loved it, yes he shared!  For his side he decided to try the potatoes Gruy\\xc3\\xa8re gratin.  Wow, so incredibly good.  This is the best side dish anywhere.  And so much for eating light!\\n\\nAfter the game, we decided to stop by again to hang out while traffic cleared out a bit.  Since this was an April game, it was a bit chilly outside, so we got coffees with Bailey's to warm us up.  We love everything about Hyde Park, especially the great service!  It's not only a great steakhouse, it's a great place for bar food, too.\",\n",
       " 434: 'Went in Friday night with my BBF to celebration a great occasion. We had reservations and were seated promptly. The host staff is warm and friendly and more than happy to take our coats. Bistro 19 is on the small side and the place was packed with the exception of the bar area. Athena appeared right away with a bread plate and to serve water and take our drink orders. I was in a festive mood and more than happy to try a signature drink, the \"Nine-teeni\". The drink was Amaretto, Three Olives Raspberry, cranberry juice with a raspberry sugared rim. Very yummy! \\n\\nFor an appetizer, we shared a jumbo lump crab cake with whole grain mustard aioli and served with a bit of parmesan pine nut salad. B.J. thought it was a bit mushy and it was, but the flavor combination was wonderful. We also ordered a Bistro salad to share, but somehow managed to get the house signature salad, the \"Pear and Roasted Beet salad\". We didn\\'t mind, it was wonderful and included candied walnuts and huge blue cheese crumbles with a nice walnut vinaigrette. \\n\\nJim ordered an evening special, scallops with homemade oxtail ravioli, also served with asparagus. Very good. I had the center cut filet mignon, with gorgonzola, wild mushroom compote, port wine demi-glace, whipped potatoes and asparagus. The steak was cooked perfectly and very delicious.  Too much for one girl, so BJ gobbled it right up! \\n\\nFor dessert we shared a dessert special, pearl tapioca with mango chutney. J. thought it was just okay, but I loved it. I have never had pearl tapioca and I really liked the texture, the fact that is wasn\\'t sickeningly sweet and thought the mango was a perfect flavored accent. Also, loved all their choices of coffee drinks. I had the Cafe Joy, which was Malibu, Bailey\\'s and Frangelico. Very good. \\n\\nThe restaurant had a steady stream of customers the entire time we were there. It was a little noisy, but the restaurant has a very warm feeling, sorta romantic, very chic and stylish. When you enter the huge front door, it\\'s like stepping into another world from away from Washington Road.  Executive chef Jessica Gibson does an amazing job and I appreciate her creative specials on the menu.  Service from Athena was excellent. Every dish was served right on time and she was incredibly professional, yet warm and friendly. I love Bistro 19. It\\'s a bit of a road trip from where I live, but worth the trip!',\n",
       " 435: \"We enjoyed Christmas dinner here this year.  Not many restaurants are open, so we were excited to be able to dine here.  \\n\\nFirst off, McCormick & Schmick is not at all what I thought it was.  I thought it was an uber cool, high end fine dining experience.  In reality, it's merely a 1/2 step above Red Lobster.  When we arrived, the lobby was jammed packed.  We were seated approximately 30 minutes after our reservation time.\\n\\nWe were lead to a table smack dab in the middle of a high traffic area.  We protested.  BJ always requests a romantic booth for two.  So after standing in the middle of the restaurant ackwardly for 5 or so minutes, we were finally taken to such a table.    \\n\\nService was friendly from Val.  BJ got a Sierra Nevade brew and I ordered a festive beverage from the cocktail menu.  My Poinsettia was sweet beyond belief and tasted sort of like perfume.  We shared a chopped salad which was fairly good.  We also shared a crab tower, which was nice.  But we have had a similiar type appetizer at Bahama Breeze that is SO much better.\\n\\nBJ wanted to be different, so he had mussels and the clam steamer for his meal.  He liked his choice and said it was okay.  I wanted to be different, too.  So, I had the lump crab cake with southewest jicama slaw and poblano cream.  I was quite put off with the appearance of my dish.  I didn't care much for the brightly color cream slopped on my plate and the slaw was down right nasty.  The crab cake was alright.\\n\\nFor dessert, we pondered our choices.  Nothing sounded very special, but our server was all about the carrot cake.  Surprisingly, it was the best part of our meal.\",\n",
       " 436: \"Review Number 600 - I decided to take BJ out for a really special dinner on Father's Day.  He likes steak and seafood, so Capital Grille came to mind.  I made a reservation through open table.  When we arrived, the restaurant was very busy, but we were seated right away.  The decor is rich dark wood walls, extraordinary light fixtures, rich woven wool carpeting, and a few mounted animal heads and statues and old world type of artwork.  I am sure you get the picture.\\n\\nFor drinks, BJ opted for his usual beer and I had a Cosmo.  We had plenty of time to study the menu.  We decided to skip the appetizers and ordered a C.G. Chopped Salad to share.  I would call this a kitchen sink salad, it was full of a lot of different fresh vegetables, served on mixed greens with house made croutons and olive vinaigrette.  I really liked the salad, very fresh and delicious.  The bread basket here is great, it offers some nice choices of bread.  \\n\\nFor our steaks, I got a filet mignon.  BJ got the seared tenderloins with butter poached lobster tails.  We decided to share the grilled asparagus based on our server's recommendation.  BJ loved his meal and that's what was important on this particular occasion.  He shared his lobster with me and it was perfectly cooked.  My steak, however was over cooked, tough and very dry.  It's a sin to see a filet prepared this way.  Also, our server seemed to be lost and didn't return to see if our steaks were cooked properly until well after BJ was done.  At that point, I wasn't really interested in a new steak.  But, as a reward for my suffering through a mediocre steak, we were given a free dessert.  Not exactly adequate, if you ask me, but better than nothing.\\n\\nWe got the cheesecake with seasonal berries.  It's described as the lighter, fluffier cousins of a New York.  Our server said it made with mascarpone and had a little crisp caramelized sugar ala creme brulee style, which was a nice touch.  The berries were raspberries, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries.  It was delicious.\\n\\nWe did have a really nice evening out.  But it's a shame that it couldn't have been perfect.  Inadequate service and a shoe leather steak prevented that.  We might try C.G., again.  But we have had such perfect meals at Morton's and Ruth Chris', we should probably stick with them.\",\n",
       " 437: \"What an incredibly beautiful restaurant!  Tonight we celebrated the birth of my angel here, his choice.  We were seated promptly for our 6 pm reservation.\\n\\nRon, our server was incredible.  Beverage choices were very good, BJ got a Samuel Adams Alpine Spring seasonal beer.  We had attended a business function here last fall and I was served a specialty beverage called a coconut macaroon, not currently on the menu.  Ron was kind enough to consult the bartender to see if they could recreate my drink, which they did.  It was just as amazing as I remember.\\n\\nFor our starters, BJ got the mussels and clams which he really enjoyed.  The portion was a nice size and he really liked the broth, which was garlic and white wine.  I opted for the beet salad.  I thought it was very good, I really liked the blue cheese and the red wine vinaigrette.\\n\\nFor our meals, BJ got the filet with lobster and the Gruyere & onion bread pudding.  His steak was served with a trio of steak sauces and grilled to perfection.  However, he thought the lobster claw meat was bit overcooked.  Also, we love fingerling potatoes but were not a fan of these.  They were a little hard and the bread pudding was a little dry.  I got the crab cakes with mac & cheese.  The crab cakes were not the Maryland style jumbo lump crab meat that I am used to.  I thought they were just okay.\\n\\nSince it was the big guy's big day, we ordered a blood orange cake for dessert.  They were thoughtful enough to write Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce.  \\n\\nAll in all, we had a mixed opinion of our experience.  The interior of the restaurant is very nice and our server Ron was amazing and provided incredible service the entire evening.  We thought that the food, while good, didn't quite measure up.  In spite of this, we will probably be back to visit, again.\",\n",
       " 438: 'We dined here for my birthday on 2/13. We had a reservation and we were seated promptly. We got a very nice table with corner bench seating, so we could sit side by side. \\n\\nOur server was efficient and very friendly. We were served the complimentary chicken pate. Sorry to say, I am not a fan of pate, but it was a very nice touch. Next came the legendary popovers. I understand that these are Chef Tourondel\\'s signature. They were so amazing. \\n\\nWe decided to share the crab cake appetizer. It was served with remoulade and spicy coleslaw. I can\\'t say enough about how delicious it was! The slaw and the crab was a perfect combination. It was definitely the best crab cake that I ever have eaten. The best! Since it was my birthday, I went a little crazy with birthday drinking. I had \"The Fountain of Youth\" which was delicious. Can\\'t remember any of the ingredients, but it\\'s an amazing drink. \\n\\nFor dinner, I had the filet mignon. Oh, my. It was perfectly cooked, and so tender and delicious with the right amount of char. I opted for the chimichurri sauce which was SO good. BJ opted for the 3 lb. lobster. Wholly, mother of lobster, it was huge and perfectly prepared. And even more amazing, he was able to eat it all. Well, I helped a bit. For sides, we selected grilled asparagus and a baked potato. The potato was served with add your own sour cream, chives, cheese and bacon. The sides were huge and meant for sharing. \\n\\nEven though we were full, we couldn\\'t not pass on dessert. We had the warm chocolate tart served with pistachio ice cream. Wow, it was so good. Also, they were thoughtful enough to serve this complimentary with a nice bday inscription on the plate complete with candle. How nice. Another thoughtful touch was a letter with the Chef thanking us for dining there and a promise of 10% off on our next visit. Wow, that\\'s sweet!  Also, the complimentary dessert cookies were also very nice!\\n\\nAs the other yelp reviewers have mentioned, this restaurant is expensive and best reserved for special occasions. However, my birthday experience here is one that will never be forgotten. It was amazing!!  Thanks BLT!',\n",
       " 439: \"We had Xmas dinner 2009 there, (I know, sometimes we get behind on our yelp reviews, but this experience was too good to just forget about).  The Terrace Room was one of the few restaurants open for the holiday and it was open in more ways than one.  Not only were they offering dinner to paying customers, elsewhere in the Omni William Penn Hotel, meals were being served to the homeless.  It was a little difficult for us to get reservations, because they were being taken by the restaurant manager only.  We left a couple messages, missed a couple call backs, but finally connected.  He was kind enough to email a menu so we knew what to expect.\\n\\nThe Terrace Room is huge and located right off the lobby of the hotel.  The holiday decorations were beautiful.  We got a nice table with a window bench seat.  Our server was very warm and friendly.  BJ ordered the Frisee & Smoked Salmon Salad with dill vinaigrette for his starter.  I got a wild mushroom & brie tart with Sherry onion confit.  Both were very good.  Next came the soup, BJ got the roasted cauliflower and I got the pumpkin bisque.  Mine was SO amazing.  I expected it to be a little sweet, but it was not.  The favor was very pure.  For our main course, BJ had a grilled pork tenderloin with sweet potato gnocchi and sauteed brussel sprouts.  I had a filet of beef with leek & apricot bread pudding, hen of the woods ragout and sherry demi-glace.  The steak rather large and perfectly cooked.  I couldn't even eat half of it!  Plus, I wanted to be sure to save room for dessert.  They served a Christmas Triology, a ginger bread cupcake, chocolate yule log and panforte.  Everything was first rate.  I would love to have Xmas dinner here, again!\",\n",

Lucky for us, we managed to get an awesome table with a view of Point State Park and the Pittsburgh\\'s Skyline.  Beautiful!  The interior of the restaurant is modern, beautiful lighting and a huge bar area.  Because the restaurant is located in a casino, no children.  The restaurant is named after important Andrews namely Carnegie, Mellon and Warhol.  \\n\\nOur server was awesome, fairly attentive throughout the evening.  We started with a shared roasted beet salad.  The arugula, goat cheese and pine nuts made it amazing.  For our meals, BJ got the hanger steak with chard, Parmesan and red wine demi.  It was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.  I got the 8 oz. filet mignon.  I was concerned about being able to eat such a big steak.  But no worries.  It was so good, I was able to eat every bite of it.  Perfectly cooked, the flavor was incredible.  For our sides, we got a trio that included lobster risotto, sweet potato puree and root vegetable.  The risotto was just okay, but the other two were outstanding.  We really enjoyed our leisurely meal here.',\n",
       " 441: 'We wandered in on a recent Sunday, shortly after noon.  I was panicked to count exactly 3 tables and 2 stools at the bar.  All of them full.  A friendly server said \"don\\'t worry, two of the tables are just finishing up\", and handed us menus to review.\\n\\nAfter we nabbed a table, our server greeted us right away.  For beverages, BJ got a diet coke, I got a horchata.  What is horchata?  It\\'s a traditional rice milk drink made with cinnamon, sugar and vanilla with a bit of fresh grated lime for garnish.  It was so good, I loved it and so did BJ.  \\n\\nOf course we had to ask what was good. Apparently their menu has some new creations.  BJ ended up selecting both of his tacos from the \"new\" items.  He got a Philly brisket taco and a chorizo taco.  The Philly taco was nothing like a Philly cheese steak, it was more like pot roast.  He said the chorizo taco was very spicy and flavorful.  It was his favorite.  I stole a few pinto beans and tomatoes from this taco.  I got a pork taco with avocado creme and one of the new creations, a chicken apple taco with smoked chicken, house made bacon, apples, white cheddar & house made smoked jalapeno mayo.  The pork was my favorite by far, stuffed with lots of huge pieces of meat.  It was perfect.  We also got a side of jalapeno apple coleslaw to share.  We were both surprised that the jalapeno didn\\'t have more of a kick.  But we loved the crispness of the cabbage and the dressing was yummy.   \\n\\nThis is me, eating at Smoke:  mmmm.......MMMMMM......mmmmmm.....  I thought my boyfriend was going to slap me.  But I couldn\\'t help it.....mmmmm..... yummm....\\n\\nWe like the rustic charm of the interior.  We were curious why there was so much space and so few tables.  Apparently, there is a business ordinance the dictates the number of tables based on the number of \"wash\" rooms.  They have one wash room.  So, although there is space for more tables, they can\\'t add any more.  Of course, the owners plan to expand and they are hoping to open a microbrewery in the basement by Fall 2012.  I am sure this business will be around for a long time.',\n",

Got got one of the tiny round marble tables along the banquet.\\n\\nOur server Brent checked in with us right away.  We thought his service was superior through out our visit.  BJ opted for a Butternuts Pork Slap and I got a Ronaldo which was house made raspberry vodka, grenadine, and citrus sparkling.  Loved my drink and BJ loved his beer!\\n\\nWhile we pondered the menu, we decided to get an appetizer and share a Wedge salad.  They were thoughtful enough to divide the salad for us.  I was surprised at the size of my half portion.  It was huge.  The wedge was baby iceberg, super crisp bacon, roasted tomatoes-yum!!, croutons, ramps-my first experience, and the most incredible house made blue cheese with nice chunks of blue cheese.  The Yukon Skins appetizer was the perfect size for two.  This was my first experience with pork belly pastrami and I liked it.  \\n\\nAfter some debate, BJ got the smoked pork chop with pastrami, baked beans and  spicy apple slaw.  I tried his meal.  The chop was incredible, as was the beans and slaw.  I loved the kick from the jalapenos.  Best slaw ever!  And the portion size was big.  It's the first time that BJ didn't finish this meal.  I am usually the one with the carry out bag.  \\n\\nI got the lobster risotto for my meal.  The portion size was fairly small, which was good because there were so many other things that I wanted to eat!  The risotto was not my favorite, it was a little too watery for my taste and the lobster was a little stringy.  Not bad, but not that great, either.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared the blueberry pana cotta.  It was cute that they served it in a mason jar, but not so great when it came to eating it.  We had to use our small coffee spoons to be able to get a nice mix of the cream with the blueberries.  Also, the texture was a bit rubbery, but we still loved the flavor.  \\n\\nFor those of you parking in the Theater Square garage, M & P is able to offer a reduced rate parking.  Just ask your server.  Loved our dinner!\",\n",

BJ got a Snapper Head Butternuts and I got an Aloe Vera Lemonade which I thought was a perfect drink.  We started with an order of grilled bread with goat butter and rhubarb jam which I thought was perfect!  BJ got the short rib hash with poached egg and  horseradish hollandaise.  He thought the flavor was excellent!!  I got one of the specials which was chorizo quesadilla served with potatoes au gratin and pickled veggies and avocado cream.  So, so yummy.  The portion sizes were adequate, leaving you satisfied but not over stuffed.\\n\\nWe also decided to have a red velvet cake and shared a Irish Breakfast coffee.  The coffee was served in a brandy glass with Jameson, bacon whipped cream and zest of orange.  Perfect ending to a fantastic brunch!\",\n",

We were greeted right away and taken in one of the booths that sit up behind the bar with a perfect view of one of the TV's.\\n\\nBJ enjoyed some Great Lakes X-mas beer.  For his meal he got their version of a Cobb salad.  Grilled chicken, peppered bacon, hard boiled egg, avocado, tomato, candied onion, crumbled Gorgonzola and a crispy pasta sheet.  Very good sized portion and everything was very fresh.  For me, I needed to get a couple snacks.  I got the buttermilk battered onion rings.  Delicious!  Be sure to eat them while they are still hot.  And I also got the pipe bombs.  They are sirloin steak, bell peppers, jalape\\xc3\\xb1os, pepper jack cheese in a crispy won-ton wrapper and served with Guinness steak sauce.  I thought they were decent, but did get any heat from the  jalape\\xc3\\xb1os peppers, which was kinda disappointing.  \\n\\nThe game was kinda long, so we had to have dessert.  We shared an apple tart ala mode.  It was fantastic!  Really a fun place to visit, good food, great service.\",\n",
       " 445: \"Gaucho.  Who doesn't love to say Gaucho?  And what meat eaters wouldn't love this tiny little spot in the Strip?\\n\\nWe arrived early on a Saturday morning.  And Chef Anthony Falcon was already performing for the crowd!  Yes, this man is a performer, describing the menu, giving tips on what to order and truly thrilling the crowd!\\n\\nSo, here is a bit of the condensed version of the story of this grill spot.  A gaucho is an Argentina cowboy.  These gauchos would grill beef over a wood fire, giving the meat an incredible flavor.  Chef Anthony's great grandfather was a gaucho in Argentina.  Be sure to search the restaurant wall for a photo of him dressed in gaucho garb.  Well, on to the story.  Chef Anthony's uncle visited Pittsburgh from Argentina and said, you have got to put a restaurant in the Strip.  And so, here we are today.  \\n\\nIt's interesting to enter and see stacks of natural hardwood everywhere.  All cooking it done by fire.  No oven.  No stove.  And definitely no microwave.  It's almost prehistoric.  Wood, fire, meat.  The day we visited, Chef Anthony was not cooking, he was entertaining and waiting on the crowd.\\n\\nNot being super hungry, we opted to order simple items.  I got a cob of corn and steak empanadas.  OMG.  Can't say enough about the awesome flavors here.  BJ got a chorizo sandwich with peppers, onion & pimenton.  So good.  Also, I added the pimenton to my empanadas.  Spectacular.  \\n\\nClearly, we need to return with an appetite.  And try more of the menu.  Can't wait for that!\",\n",
       " 446: 'BJ may not be my Daddy, but I took him to Texas De Brazil for Father\\'s Day anyway!\\n\\nWe have dined at locations in Florida and Illinois, so we knew exactly what to expect from Texas De Brazil.  But what we didn\\'t expect was the \"Burghin-ization\" of this chain.  At other locations, you are greeted at an elegant and serene hostess stand away from the dining room.  In Da Burgh, it\\'s more like walking into a high school gymnasium.  We had to shout at the hostess so she could hear our names.  The acoustics are horrendous.  The beautiful lighting fixtures are lost in the din of the ugly black ceiling.  The tables are helter skelter.  As another diner mentions, you can\\'t go to the ladies room without having to knock at least 3 people over.  \\n\\nThe elegant salad bar topped with their signature massive floral arrangement seems surrounded by the homeless lining up for their last meal.  Even the gauchos are different here.  Some of them are a wee bit timid, rather then proudly strutting around to show their meat. Maybe they will get of the hang of it.  Maybe not.  Where are the elegant white table linens?  Where is the incredible service?  To our dear servers, I am sure you are exhausted.  But please don\\'t complain to me about how hard to you have to work and how much your feet hurt.  I am here to celebrate!  Only in Pittsburgh.  Now if you can just get by all that.....\\n\\nWe loved dining here.  Even with the lack of ambiance and stiff service, the food is still the number one star.  The salad and hot food bar is amazing.  The lobster bisque is delicious.  The salads are incredible.  And the Brazilian potato salad and marinated veggies are so good.  I am in love with the  pineapple carpaccio.  We loved adding the mushrooms with our beef.  And I am not sure why, but every meat tastes extraordinary at TDB.  Love the anticipation of waiting to see what yummy meat will show up our table next.  When we weren\\'t seeing the bacon wrapped filet, we had to ask for it.  And we had to ask a second time.  So, don\\'t be timid about asking for anything in particular.  For dessert, not included, we shared an incredible slice of pecan pie a la mode.  Sweet ending to an incredible meal.\\n\\nJust a couple of helpful tips.  Try not to eat anything on the day of your visit.  Maybe even the evening before.  It would be a shame to not be able to try all of the TDB offerings.  And be sure to visit their web site and sign up for their E-club.  I see a free birthday and anniversary meal in your future.',\n",
       " 447: \"We went here for their Mother's Day Buffet.  It was a last minute idea and lucky for us, we had no problem getting a reservation.  We had requested a booth and we got a wonderful and roomy curved booth with a wonderful view of flowering bushes outside.  The interior of the restaurant is beautiful, rich wood, beautiful lighting.\\n\\nWe were greeted right away and ordered beverages and advised that they would be delivered by our server.  And we were off to check out the buffet.  They had an omelet station and lots of breakfast items including muffins and pastries.  BJ started off with mac & cheese, meatloaf and fried chicken.  I went straight to the salads, Eddie's chopped salad as very good, the Waldorf salad was amazing.  So were the peel and eat shrimp.  They were a good size and the cocktail sauce had an extra kick.  \\n\\nFor meats, they served hand craved ham and chateaubriand.  I loved both, BJ thought that the ham was a bit dry.  I thought that the cream horseradish needed more kick.  The chef did bring BJ some straight horseradish was the kitchen.  \\n\\nI can't say enough about the dessert bar which was set up in the bar area.  They had a lot a of tiny little choices.  The best was the pecan and chocolate bars and the tiny carrot cake cupcakes with cream cheese icing.\\n\\nAll in all, a good experience.  The only negative was our server.  She didn't know how to refill water glasses.  I drank both mine and BJ's before I got a refill.  BJ had to wait forever for an offer of another beer.  And she rarely took away our empty plates.  You know, it's not a tough shift, being a server for a buffet.  But it was for her.  Not the quality of service you would expect from an expensive steak house.\",\n",
       " 448: \"This review is for brunch only! I've never been here for dinner...but been here quite a few times for brunch.\\n\\nCasbah's brunch is a prix fixe...which at first seems expensive, but when you realize the amount of food you're getting, it's sooo not. You get an appetizer, entree, and drink (yes, a real drink, with alcohol) for just $24. I usually end up spending more at my other Big Burrito brunch spot, Kaya, so I consider this a pretty good deal.\\n\\nThey start you off with a basket of muffins and biscuits with honey butter on the side. And it's refillable. Try to restrain yourself from eating too many baked goods though, so you can get to the real food. For appetizers, everything I've had was pretty good (polenta and the salads have been my faves), but for the entree, there is only ONE thing you should order: The lamb & eggs!  Crusty sourdough bread topped with spinach topped with braised lamb shoulder and roasted garlic, topped with poached eggs. One of the best things I have ever eaten in the morning. The scallop scramble is just okay, the steak & eggs are pretty delish...but the lamb & eggs is by far the best thing on the brunch menu.\\n\\nThis is one of the few places where I don't opt for the Bloody Mary...it's pretty blah. I do their Salty Dog with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, or sometimes get it sans alcohol if I'm really feeling the pain from Saturday night.\\n\\nUnfortunately, while I love the atmosphere, I feel like the service is lacking. I can't explain why, but it always feels awkward and doesn't hold up to the standards set at other Big Burrito spots (even Mad Mex). I know it gets busy on Sundays, but still. Service issues aside, The food is still worth it.\",\n",
       " 449: \"Good, solid meal here. It's very much a traditional French restaurant without too much creative going on on the menu, but everything was executed very well.\\n\\nWe started with a cheese/meat board that had a good variety of components. We then did the steak tartare and the escargot, followed by the mussels. Everything was delicious. My only complaint would be that the broth for the mussels was somewhat bland, but the mussels were plump and fresh. I also thought the frites were just okay.\\n\\nI honestly don't have much to say about this place because there just wasn't anything to really RAVE about, however if you're visiting Montreal and want some French food at an affordable price, it's a good pick!\",\n",
       " 450: \"I feel like my previous reviews are not super helpful due to the ever-changing menu at Salt, and after eating here five times now I feel like I can make some generalizations.\\n\\nCocktails: Delicious, but sometimes a little boring in comparison to the food.\\n\\nAppetizers: Tartare, sashimi, soup, and salad are, in my experience, always on point. I've dabbled with some of the other things and had mixed feelings, from excellent (octopus, escargot, scallops, beef tongue) to interesting-but-not-sure-if-I-like-it (cockscombs, chicken liver) to I-want-to-like-this-but-I-really-don't (chawanmushi). Sometimes I feel like things go a little overboard and the food is weird just for the sake of being weird. After my last visit, I've vowed to always ask about the preparations--I ordered the lobster appetizer and what I expected was succulent chunks of lobster. What I got was a texturally disturbing cake of ground lobster. Even with the foolproof garnish of shaved truffle and chicken skin, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was eating really expensive cat food.\\n\\nMain courses: Compared to the adventurous appetizers, the main courses are less crazy. But simple doesn't make them boring, and I haven't had a bad one yet. I usually get whatever the steak or shortrib option is (favorite combo was with beet puree and bleu cheese), but I always try to sneak a bite of my dining companions' plates since just about everything else is awesome too. And the portions are larger than you would expect for this type of restaurant (good thing).\\n\\nDesserts: Like the appetizers, this is where things get a little weird again. Unlike the appetizers, which can be hit or miss, the desserts are usually a win. Strange custards, gelatins, and foams abound but somehow something as unappetizing as a celery sorbet or candied parsnips ends up being not only good but memorable.\\n\\nOverall, Salt earns its reputation as one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh, and the food being served here would easily cost twice as much in a large city. Some of their selections might be more successful than others, but at least the experience is always interesting!\",\n",
       " 451: 'Having been to Meat & Potatoes at least ten times now, I\\'ve had some really amazing meals here, definitely worthy of 5 stars. But I also think things can be a bit inconsistent here. Although it\\'s definitely one of my favorite spots in the \\'burgh, it\\'s just short of perfection.\\n\\nJust like everyone else in the world, I love love love the ambiance here. I find the chairs a little uncomfortable (probably because I\\'m short and can\\'t reach the table...I should really consider bringing a booster seat) but other than that, everything is gorgeous speakeasy chic and is a good match for the upscale comfort food theme. It also has a great vibe for some classy drinking, and I\\'d certainly visit the bar more often if I had the $$$\\n\\nAlso, in love with the brunch. I really do think this is the best brunch in the city. The shortrib hash and the korean brisket & eggs are my favorite dishes, and who can resist a $5 DIY bloody mary bar with house-infused vodkas in flavors like bacon and shallot?? I know I can\\'t...though I wish I could so I could try the various flavors of bellini they offer. If you only eat one brunch in Pittsburgh, this is the one you want to try.\\n\\nThe dinner is where I\\'ve had some mixed experiences. The steaks and other mains are usually awesome. The mussels have been less impressive, and on the last visit I ordered a version with \"balsamic pearls\" that I expected to mimic the texture of the salmon roe in the dish. Instead there were just clumps of chewy, stale-tasting balsamic vinegar interspersed among the shells. Something is also off in their steak tartare, and trust me...I LOVE tartare. I just think the flavors they choose in trying to be creative don\\'t always work in harmony. But the simple things, the \"meat and potatoes\" if you will, are done wonderfully, and that\\'s what you should come here for.',\n",
       " 452: \"If you haven't been since they opened, I'd recommend giving Union another try. Things have changed a lot, it seems.\\n\\nMost notably, they now offer combos: for $20 you can get 2 meats, 1 side, and a piece of cornbread OR all three meats (brisket, pork shoulder, ribs). If you decide to substitute chicken for one of your meats, you can do so for $5. The portion sizes have gotten much bigger (I got an order of brisket just to myself, and it literally would have been enough to feed 3-4 people). And praise Jesus, the Kansas City BBQ sauce no longer tastes like straight ketchup. They also now offer a couple creative appetizer options (things such as pork belly wraps and steak tartare) that are very much in the vein of Salt of the Earth, and the mac & cheese and greens are still insanely good. The cocktail list has been vastly expanded, too. My boozy, peachy Arnold Palmer was pretty delicious.\\n\\nAs far as the meats, my favorite is the brisket. Each time I've gotten it, it has been super tender with lots of melty fat, and I love the flavor of the rub. You don't even really need the sauce. The pork shoulder is my second fav, but I was a little let down by the ribs. They have a nice smoky flavor, but were pretty dry and didn't have that fall-off-the-bone quality that makes ribs so great. The ribs are what keeps me from giving Union 5 stars, but otherwise this is a great place for a refined approach to BBQ.\",\n",

Given that, we went here for a birthday dinner.\\n\\nOverall, we were all left with kind of a \"meh\" experience.  Our server seemed pretty disinterested and slow.  I think the low point was someone ordered a steak medium rare (for $38).  What came out was a well done and COLD piece of meat.  It looked like a hockey puck. \\n\\nWhen he sent it back, no apology...and no change in the bill.  I at least expected a manager or someone to come out and apologize and say \"We\\'ve taken it off the bill\" or SOMETHING.  Nope.

I\\'m going to admit right off the bat that I am docking them 1-1.5 stars for the lack of really good culinary choices. Resorts that charge $400 a night (at non-group rates) should have many quality dining options that range from modest to pricey. This place is not like that. Very few options at very high prices. I\\'m actually a bit surprised, since I would have expected their clientele to want significant variety. The \"flagship\" here (which I admit I haven\\'t tried) has a menu that is a fairly generic overpriced \"steakhouse\" menu with a few \"southwestern\" alternatives. Having traveled a little bit, it has become easy to recognize the conference center flagship restaurant menu - big steaks that come without any sides, basic pasta dish, basic fish dish, sesame crusted tuna, molten lava cake, etc. These places never appeal to me and I usually trek off to see what else is out there - it can be a problem if the resort is ALL that is out there, though.\\n\\nI digress - so, 1-1.5 points off for that. Now on to the good stuff. The resort is in Scottsdale, which appears to be a well groomed desert community with lots of shopping and dining options, so we were able to walk about 5 minutes over to an upscale shopping district with great options for sushi, french bistro, italian, and other fare. That was a lifesaver, because the close-by shopping area had great sushi and a nice French bistro to keep me happy.\\n\\nBeds and room were very comfortable, and the staff were friendly.

A glance at the enormous menu offering what appeared to be a mundane slew of tired old \"American Food\" items left me a bit melancholy as well. I think that I am a bit less critical because these two first impressions set the bar a little low for me.\\n\\nBUT... the draft beer was nice and cold, the staff working up on the deck that night were very attentive and friendly, and the gyro I ordered was... AWESOME! (One of the wait staff recommended it, saying it was probably the best thing on the menu.) Forget $50 porterhouse steaks here - why the hell would you do that? Go to Morton\\'s, Capital Grille, or Ruth\\'s Chris if you want to spend a fistful of money on some muscle to gnaw on.\\n\\nI would disagree with the 5 star (?!?!) and 1 star reviews here. This place isn\\'t The French Laundry on Mount Washington OR Pittsburgh Food Hell Meets Third World Inflation... It is a place with a great view and some tasty items you have to sort out from the rest of the \"Bennigan\\'s meets TGI Friday\\'s meets Applebee\\'s meets Bar Food\" stuff. If you have the time and the patience, give the place a try if you are in the vicinity. Hopefully you will visit on a good night, and the view will make up for most of the shortcomings you may encounter.\\n\\nAnd remember to set your expectations appropriately - the Michelin reviewers will never set foot in this place.

I think my beer was $8 for a 24 oz cup of Yuengling. Hot dogs could be done with a little more pizzazz. Franktuary and Station Street guys, are you reading this? Why not try and strike up a conversation with the Heinz Field folks like other Pittsburgh \"favorites\" so we can enjoy some variety here?\\n\\nI liked walking around and watching the tailgaters, and stopped in to a nearby steakhouse to have a few beers with friends before the game - it\\'s a nice, convenient sports area, anchored by this great open-air stadium.

So far, our favorite burger was the Steakhouse burger, which literally is like eating a great steak at a great steak restaurant... hell, it\\'s better!

We appreciated the hospitality the wait staff demonstrated, and everyone treated us and our daughter very well. Try the octopus with gorgonzola - not cheap, but WELL worth the price! Anything with cod or seafood is delicious. I am told their steaks are quite good as well, but we have enjoyed the seafood items so much that we haven't ever ordered it!\\n\\nOf course, there are also some areas for improvement. The comment one reviewer had about the size of their menu and the number of specials offered is as true as can be. It would be really nice if they would rotate dishes in and out of the menu, to offer some variety and reduce confusion. Personally, I like seeing 5-8 appetizers, 6-8 main courses, and 3-4 desserts on a typical menu. It would likely be best to have 3-4 specials in addition to the menu for variety.\\n\\nRead a little about Portuguese cuisine, and then order accordingly - they are definitely adept at this niche area of cuisine!\\n\\nMore to come as we continue to explore their offerings...\",\n",

I promise that my observations about this fabulous place will not steer you amiss!\\n\\nOk, so there are a few things I always like to notice when I come to a new place. These are customer behaviors that always raise my expectations for the better:\\n\\n1) When restaurant patrons are eagerly eyeing other customers\\' dishes as they come out of the kitchen\\n\\n2) When I see the owner or chef of another wonderful local place taking the night off to enjoy the cuisine of the place we are eating at.\\n\\nI can honestly say that I was pleased to see both of these events occur before my fleeting eyes this evening... Every single person at this place was greedily eyeing the plates coming from the kitchen with an almost child-like eagerness that rivals the face children make when opening Christmas presents. We were happy to see someone from another great place (Fukuda) being seated.\\n\\nMy wife and I guiltily  stole away from home this evening, leaving our disappointed little one with the babysitter for a much deserved \\'grown-up\\' night. I had read so many amazing reviews on Yelp that I simply could not help myself.\\n\\nI am in total agreement with those who believe that eating out at a great establishment should be an experience that pleases ALL of the senses. The powers that be at Cure have really thought this through. Yes, it is a small restaurant, and at first, you wonder how much a little place like this can impress, but it does!\\n\\n- SMELL - As you walk up to this unassuming establishment, you can smell the deliciousness emanating from within. The delicious aromas of smoky Nirvana welcome you, before you even open the door, and envelop your soul while you are seated at your table.\\n\\n- VISION - The interior of the establishment is lovely. From the embossed ceiling, to the raw wood floors and walls, this place is warm and inviting. Chairs and booths are comfortable, and this is exactly what one would desire at a place named \"Cure\"\\n\\n- SOUND - Tonight, I asked the owner, \"Who makes the soundtrack for the establishment?\" He answered that it was a completely collaborative effort - impressive. The best way to describe the lovely music we heard is that it is an eclectic mix of Satchmo with Squirrel Nut Zippers and vintage acoustic jazz. It just feels right. Yes, taste and hearing can be complimentary, and I applaud this establishment for really paying incredible attention to this detail, which is so often neglected!\\n\\n- TOUCH - They even provide tactile stimulation that suits their mission. Yes, fine restaurants always address this subtly - remember the \"feel\" of the fine paper your menu was printed on at that 3 star Michelin restaurant? Yes, they were appealing to your sense of touch. Cure does this more simply, with beautifully crafted hardwood boards they use for the menus and the bill. The boartds are soft and luxurious, and really complement the whole idea of smoked foods. Bravo!\\n\\n- TASTE - Yes, I kept this for last. The most incredible part of the evening was the flavors this team put on stage for us tonight. I chose the hanger steak, since I love its versatility and its complexity. It takes skill to make this cut taste like an indulgence -  Tonight, they served the meat with charred ramps, smoked and charred red onions and fingerling potatoes, and a trio of delicious dipping sauces - spicy pepper orange, white aioli, and green salsa verde. My wife had the asparagus trio, which was sublime, and also enjoyed a moist, savory chicken dish with multiple preparation styles.\\n\\nI almost forgot to compliment the beverages - kudos to them for having local Draai Laag beer on the menu... It pairs perfectly with all dishes we tried. Their bar looks fabulous, and their offerings on the drink menu appeared quite inviting.\\n\\nOverall, a stunning experience.\\n\\nWill most definitely be back - what an amazing meal!!!!',\n",

Wine list had multiple options by the glass.\\n- As for the meal, the meats were good cuts, well prepared. \\n\\nCONS: \\n- Overall the food felt rich with creams, fats, salt without any particular inspiration showing through. The ingredients were all good and well sourced, but the finished products did not seem to elevate them in any particular way. \\n- The service was high end of amateur - not what I was expecting from this caliber of restaurant. Our 30 minute wait stretched to 1hr 30min without any meaningful acknowledgement by the staff. Upon sitting we were told that they usually have \"excellent sourdough bread\", but they were out of it for tonight so we had ciabatta (which was fine, but we didnt need to hear what we didn\\'t get to have). \\n\\nFOOD: (vegetarian options reviewed directly, meat options as reported by dining companions)\\n- Cheese plate: Nicely prepared with a good range of cheeses. Only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them. \\n- Beet salad: the greens were good, the dressing was a bit too mild to offset the beets, the beets themselves were gritty and not particularly well cooked. \\n- Squash soup: Overall very good - quite rich but flavorful. Felt like the salt and cream were taking over the squash \\n- Mushroom pasta: Again quite rich and salty. Packed with high quality mushrooms but didn\\'t feel that they were quite given justice due to the salt and butter. Pasta was high quality but again, overshadowed by the salt and butter. \\n- Steak: Good cut of meat, cooked well.\\n- Ragu pasta: Excellent pasta dish well cooked, reported to be almost as good as Piccolo Forno\\'s. \\n\\nOVERALL: \\nA similar experience at 2/3 the price would have received 3 stars, for the price of the meal this was barely a 2 star event. We won\\'t be going back, even with the lure of 2 for 1 entrees around our birthdays - the food just isn\\'t that good even discounting the service. I\\'m sure they will continue to do well with a certain crowd, but there are much better dinner options out there.',\n",
       " 469: 'I came for the Sunday brunch prix fixe menu - you get one appetizer and entree with a classy cocktail. I made reservations online a few weeks in advance, and the restaurant, even with decent indoor and large outdoor (with heat lamp) seating, became pretty packed. \\n\\nFor the appetizer, I was able to try the Granola, Fruit and Yogurt, the Tomato & Basil Bisque, and the Mushroom and Celery Root Puree, and all were equally delicious. The mushroom and celery root puree I was a little wary of, but it was delicious. \\n\\nFor the entree, I tried Steak and Egg, Sea Scallop Fry, and the Braised Lamb & Eggs. The portions were substantial and the flavors were all there. The runny yolk with the steak and lamb were glorious. They also have other standard brunch entrees, such as a benedict and waffles, but I felt like this was something you can get anywhere.\\n\\nOverall, really satisfied with the brunch we had.

The bread was porous and too big for the small amount of unseasoned chicken. I probably ate like 300 calories worth of hot sauce of ketchup to make up for it. And I think there was cheese- if it was there, I didn't taste it.\\n\\nThe regular and sweet potato fries are awesome. Besides that, the subs are not worth your calories. Well, at least the price was right.\",\n",

It was soft and so chewy!\\n\\nThere is a decent size dining room if you want to eat in. They also have options for other hot and cold sammiches. \\n\\nA good option for a quick, cheap and delicious bite.',\n",
       " 472: 'Not all components of the meal were impressive, but I really enjoyed the specials that they had the particular evening we went: Squid Ink Pasta and Steak and Frites. \\nThe Squid Ink Pasta had a great texture and chew to it, and none of the \"seafood-y\" taste, smell, or grittiness. Lots of fresh seafood and a great tomato sauce to finish! Very impressed.\\nI thought that the Steak and Frites would be your typical thinnish-strip steak, but the steak we received was thick, cooked perfectly, and super tender. The frites were very, very salty.\\n\\nWe also tried the Bone Marrow (described at \"meat butter\") by the staff, and it came with grilled bread, gremolata and pickled onions. It was a bit too fatty and greasy for me, and I wasn\\'t a particular fan, but I had to try it since I was there.\\nThe Fried Brussel Sprouts were less impressive- super salty and the sprout leaves weren\\'t that crisp as I\\'ve seen at some other restaurants. Lemon aioli was good. \\nThe Smoked Brisket Mac and Cheese was fine- nothing particularly stood out to me, and if I were to return, I would try something else. \\n\\nIn general, service was fine. We enjoyed the Squid Ink Pasta and Steak and Frites, though they are not on the regular menu. Overall, a lot of the dishes were on the salty side.',\n",

All the dishes were satisfactory, and no particular complaints for service. This place is not too busy, so for a weekend low-key dinner, I would recommend coming here.\\n\\nThe dishes I've tried a bit like tapas- most dishes were too small for one, so we ended up ordering a bunch:\\n\\n- Takoyaki: deep-fried here. A little skimpy on the octopus, but OK\\n- Grilled eggplant: loved the miso-BBQ sauce that goes with it, decent portions\\n- Korokke: good vegetarian option! Kinda like a Japanese samosa if you aren't familiar\\n- Hanbaggu steak: a ground meat patty with a special sauce without the bun; OK option\\n- Hiroshimayaki: like the Okonomiyaki except you get a layer of yakisoba noodles\\n\\nTopped off with a Sapporo.\",\n",

I tried it for the first time a few weeks ago, and I took crazy pictures and sent it to all my friends. I told them they had to visit just for the sandwich alone!\\n\\nThe steak sandwich is truly their best thing. It's grilled and seasoned perfectly! Although they have a sauce station, it really isn't necessary. The broiche bun is also chewy, and it doesn't get soggy. The papas (potatoes) are done well, and the grilled corn- a must as well.\\n\\nI loved, loved it. I've had similar offerings in other major cities, and this is one of best sandwiches I've tried.

       " 476: \"AMAZING! We heard Casbah had the best Calamari in Pittsburgh so we just had to try. So when we made a trip to Pittsburg in late summer this was one of our first stops. Had the calamari, and it was OUTSTANDING! Its nice and crisp and has that crunchy but not overpowering outer fryer coating, and then it had this lemon aoli that was under it. And just on the edges there was this sweet chili sauce with just enough spice, if you took up a piece, dipped it in the lemon, and then the chili, it was one of the best things I have ever eaten, and I have eaten some good stuff. After the calamari we chose their three course lunch meal for only $16. For $16 you get so much amazing food! It starts out with a cup of soup, I chose the squash pur\\xc3\\xa9e, and oh my goodness was it good! It was this thick pur\\xc3\\xa9e of butternut squash but it had toasted sesame on top and had some very developed rich flavors. After he soup I got half swordfish sandwich and again, AMAZING! I'm a sucker for swordfish so I may not be the most unbiased person, but it was soooo good! It had a nice medium rare swordfish steak on two nicely toasted pieces of homemade bread, and on top was clean and crisp vegetables to make the whole meal so light, and there was this dressing on it that words can't describe. My final course was the gnocchi, and I was literally speechless after just one bit of this heavenly gnocchi. I mean I have been talking this place up, but this gnocchi was to die for. I literally told the waitress, I would die for just one more bite. It was like little pillows of goodness in this rich sauce with shagbark hickory nuts and hen of the woods mushrooms. The strong flavor of the hickory nuts and the woods mushrooms compliments the softness of the gnocchi perfectly! Oh, and it had rich duck configue in it and the nice meaty duck left you feeling full afterwards. Overall, amazing restaurant, I have been back 2 times since then and have been astounded by their food every time. I highly recommend this to anyone with $16 and a tongue.\",\n",

I had the cheese steak and my husband had a peanut tofu wrap, both were served with chips.  Everything was great.  If I had any complaint it would be that I didn't see on the menu that my cheese steak had mayo on it.  I'm not a big fan of it, so had I see that I would have asked for it without.

I can't put my finger on it, as there really doesn't appear to be much to them in terms of some sort of secret cooking technique, but holy crap, I can't get enough of them!  I had 3 orders in 2 days, and since it's tofu & not some greasy wings... it's a legitimately healthy meal/snack.\\nThe Cheesy Snake -- a vegetarian cheese steak -- can be made with vegan cheese, and it's pretty slammin, too.  \\nThe slaw tastes like liking a brick of salt, and the coffee etiquette -- pouring old pots into other, half-full pots -- leaves a bit to be desired, but overall, I know that it's one of a few places in Pittsburgh that serves vegan food that's pretty awesome.\",\n",

       " 480: 'I am not really certain how this place is getting the stellar reviews that it has. we just had a quick bite there last night and it was easily one of the worst meals that I have ever had the pleasure of paying for. While the people running the shop were lovely, it was not worth the $17 or so we paid.\\n\\nI had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce. you would think that might be a nice time to let me know that they use some sort of house garlic-herb mayo instead of actual mayo. but no. So after a good bit of waiting my sub comes out with this weird speckly dressing on top of the lettuce... yes, this is that mayo - which is disgusting. I thought it was ranch and that is when he lady, with a smile, explained it was their house mayo... no, they don\\'t use regular mayo here. \\n\\nso, let me tell you about this mayo:\\n\\n1. it is heavily flavored with garlic powder - which tastes seriously like chemicals on a good day and just should not be considered food in any way shape or form. Mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix? who knows. all I could taste was the overwhelming chemical, fake garlic flavor. Hey, I love garlic and cook with it daily - mind you I actually use the real stuff. \\n\\n2. it is really thin... I mean thin like salad dressing, runny, thin. Um, isn\\'t mayo supposed to be thick and spreadable? even the stuff you see at subway is thicker. this stuff tasted like really cheap, bad, ranch dressing.\\n\\nSo, after giving it a good effort to try to eat this \"sub\" - I gave up and picked off the bread on the top of the sub - the bread was pretty stellar though. still hungry I decided to try to scrap off the mayo/lettuce disaster and go for the meat and cheese. um... salt? the meat, which suspiciously looked like those thin sheets of steak-um had zero flavor. one bite and I rejected it. While we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage? I am paying almost 6 bucks for this sub. I want to see yummy chopped up steak bits like you see at even a mall sub shop. not this grey, disgusting 1980s looking flavorless \"meat\".  At least the bottom of the sub roll was salvageable... I ate the bread. \\n\\nOn to the pizza. My husband had two slices of pepperoni and my daughter had a slice of plain cheese. \\n\\nOk, pizza. well, this too was a massive disappointment. since I was still hungry after dumping the majority of my sub I tried both of their pizza slices. it reminded me of a nice store-bought frozen pizza. yes, bland. bad sauce with flavorless cheese. \\n\\nMy husband is a freak for pepperoni pizza and of the two slices he almost finished one of them. yes, more for the garbage. My daughter? she is three.. she isn\\'t really a foodie (yet) but she got thru some of her cheese pizza... she actually spit some of it out but to be fair - she is three. I tried her pizza and honestly, all I could manage to somewhat enjoy was the crust which was nothing to rave about but it was tolerable. \\n\\nTo provide a baseline - we typically order from Rialto\\'s and while they are not terrible they decent enough for a sub shop - pizza place.  this place... ugh. never. again. ever. We ended up throwing out about 80% of what we paid for. This place insults their customers with sub-par, dated, poor quality food.',\n",

The parmesan cheese tasted old and well, sorta like it had been shaved off the block of cheese ages ago - it was sort of rubbery and bland as well. My steak was more medium than mid-rare and they included a peppercorn sauce which sounded good on the menu but had far too many peppercorns in it and ruined the dish... the mashed potatoes were really good once i picked out the peppercorn overload seeping into it. The broccoli served on the side was barely steamed and seasoned with some surprising and awful seasoning. Completely disappointing.  \\n\\nMy husband's salad looked much more appetizing... baby field greens and ranch dressing - he was happy. He asked for a shrimp alfredo which they did make special for him (they have it as chicken alfredo on the menu). I tasted the sauce and it was ok but very thin and could have used more cheese to add more flavor as well as thicken it. He was happy with the meal but admitted to me that Girasole's alfredo was much much better. \\n\\nSo no, I don't see us heading back anytime soon for anything other than perhaps a bunch meal. I will say that the service was excellent - the waitstaff was attentive and friendly and they did a great job but the food is overpriced for the quality of preparation.\",\n",

I ordered the Sauerbraten with kraut and german potato salad. what arrived was two slabs of hard, grey meat that lacked any flavor (hello? season your food, please) and was dry and tough. i was so hungry that i forced down half of it but just could not manage to talk myself into choking down the other piece. The potato salad was pretty good but the kraut was awful - no flavor. ugh. the plate was a mess. \\n\\nat the end of the meal we were comped dessert due to table shuffling and big parties arriving etc... the chocolate raspberry cake was excellent, I suspect brought in and they make a good cup of coffee. \\n\\nAll in all, come for the beer but pack a sandwich.

It\\'s hypnotizing.\\n\\nNow that we got that out of the way, let\\'s talk about  the restaurant!\\n\\nAfter months of whining, a group of 8 of us finally decided to nut up or shut up and finally made plans.

The building is a three-story, traditional townhouse  that is very narrow leaving only so much space inside for the dining area, bar, and the kitchen. And, it is located in the middle of Allentown. Yes, Allentown. This fact could qualify as the baby elephant in the room but it seems to be the trend to operate fantastic restaurants in areas that would make your average xenophobe from suburbia go bat shit cray cray.

The locals who walked by smiled and nodded as if they were giving us their approval. It\\'s as if the restaurant was under a dome, protected by a force field that doesn\\'t allow the stereotypical nonsense most would fear when entering Allentown at night. \\n\\nWe were greeted by our server who immediately took our drink orders. I didn\\'t see a bar on the first floor so I almost hesitated to order my usual dirty martini and my sweetheart\\'s Manhattan, thinking they were limited in their mixology. Orders were taken without pause and both drinks were most impressive.

Yes, shared. The meatball is bigger than Barry Bonds and Kanye West\\'s egos combined. And, it was friggin\\' fantastic. The flavors, the marinara sauce, the mozzarella stuffed inside...If I could marry a meatball, this would be matrimonial bliss.\\n\\nMy sweetheart chose the highly recommended veal chop Milanese. This is yet another piece of meat listed on the menu not small in size. Because I am always the a-hole of the group, I asked if I could have Linguine and Clam sauce instead of the pasta prep on the menu. Again, no hesitation. Wow. But the groans from my our table makes me still an a-hole. I DON\\'T CARE! IT WAS MY CARB DAY DAMNIT! :-)\\n\\nOur entrees did not disappoint. TASTY!!!! The entrees minus the pasta came with salad and pasta side served family style. Lots of food to be shared.\\n\\nWe finished with the hand-spun espresso gelato. Others at the table went for other gelato flavors and the Tiramisu. We all had spoons to share. All were \"delish\".\\n\\nI was tempted to order the other highly recommended entree, the Cowboy Steak Diane. My friend Beth had the pleasure. The wild mushrooms on her dish looked just as big as the meatballs and she raved about the Worcestershire butter.

       " 494: 'A Tuesday evening with two others...we wanted to take advantage of the Restaurant week menu. For $25 you had a choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert. The choices were not slim pickens and even included a beef entree (I find most Restaurant Week menus tend to steer a way from beef and offer only chicken, fish, etc.).\\n\\nThe place was full so we headed to nicely lit bar  with two smiling female bartenders to take our drink orders. There was a 40 minute wait so we started off with chips, guacamole until a table for three became available. After 30 minutes and filling up on the chips, we decided to eat at the bar. We all chose the Restaurant Week menu special. I ordered the Mac\\'n Cheese \"MACCARONES Y QUESO\", Mexican \"Mac n Cheese,\" jalapeno, pepita-cornmeal crust, chorizo or bacon. My colleagues ordered the CODZITOS, Fried ta.quitos with sweet potatoes and escarole, salsa roja, queso fresco. Both very good and very filling, particularly the mac\\'n cheese presented in small cast iron skillet. Very cheesy ad fantastic. Could have been an entree for me.\\n\\nOur entrees were the CARNE ASADA, Grilled tequila-marinated steak, chimichurri, sweet potato, crispy onion. And, TAMALES DE PAVO, Citrus-brined turkey and masa steamed in corn husks, mango-jalapeno BBQ sauce. The Carne Asada really upstaged the Tamales. Very flavorful and filling. The presentation with sweet potato wedges and onion rings was very \"cool\".  Even the  clear glass, square plates were warm.\\n\\nThe desserts TORTA DE RON, Traditional Mexican rum cake with Flor de Ca\\xc3\\xb1a; and \\nTRES LECHES PUD\\xc3\\x8dN DE PAN, Chocolate bread pudding, caramelized almonds, espresso cream were delicious but frankly, we couldn\\'t finish either. My favorite was the rum cake. It\\'s in my fridge for movie night in my living room. :-)\\n\\nThe drink menu was limited but I was impressed by the featured Malbec. My colleagues participated in the Nescal flight with sangrita.  Check times were a slow, more than 20 minutes for entrees and dessert but nothing to bitch about. It was a good experience with tasty, flavorful and awesomely presented food, pleasant staff, and average service (check times can be improved). I will definitely return.',\n",

He said it was the best steak he\\'s had since we left Nebraska, so that\\'s a pretty high compliment.\\n\\nYes, this place is expensive ($50-ish/entree), but you can DEFINITELY get at least two meals from one, and there is an option to share a dinner with a $15 charge for the extra pasta and salad dish, which may be the route I would take in the future since I\\'m a snacker and would rather have an appetizer as dinner anyway.\\n\\nI think everyone in the \\'burgh should try this place at least once, for a special occasion dinner because it\\'s awesome!',\n",

I was looking around at the online menu before we left for dinner, and much to my disappointment the Old Canadian was no longer on the menu at the restaurant.  However, the waitress checked and had the bartender make one for me anyway! Woohoo! It was delicious maple-y whiskey goodness. :)\\n\\nWe also shared poutine (hey, I'm an Old Canadian, remember??) and i was great.  Not at ALL like the fast food nacho cheese fries I remember having in Quebec as a little kid...but in a good way.  Nice, crispy fries with mushroomy gravy and real cheese.

       " 500: \"Rating the overall experience we had here.\\n\\nFirst off this is family style multi-course meal;  every main dish comes with a salad and pasta dish to share.  The salad is one of the best salads I remember eating and could easily be enough for an appetizer.  The pasta tossed in a vodka sauce was just ok.  The homemade pasta is not actually made in house (I asked), but it is 'fresh,' which I'm assuming meant bought from a store on the strip or a market district.\\n\\nWe had also ordered the calamari and the meatball appetizer because we were starving and that proved to be way too much food for a family of 5.  If you must get an appetizer, I highly recommend the meatball, you will not regret.\\n\\nThe veal chop is easily the best thing on the menu and where Alla Famiglia really shines.  From all the pasta plates and steaks and seafood dishes that were ordered at our table, the veal chop was by the unanimous favorite at our table.  Incredible flavors and tender cuts, but by the time you get to the main course, you're full with the bread, salad, and pasta that comes before you can't really enjoy it fully.  Most plates come with a side of their grilled veggies (which again were ok), but some dishes come with nothing so I would make sure to ask if you need a side.   So long story short, this is a marathon and don't expect to be done in an hour and a half.  Pace so you can really enjoy that veal chop at the end!\\n\\nWhen you first walk in it seems very small, but there are back rooms and stairs that go up one or two floors.  There's also a back patio one floor up from ground floor.  It's tight sitting spaces, but very cute and authentically Italian.  \\n\\nSo now that we established that the ambiance and food are pretty solid, the thing that earned this 3 stars is how we were hosted to our table.  We had a reservation at 7:30pm and were 30minutes early, which we recognize is nowhere near to our reservation time so we elected to grab drinks and sit on the patio.  When 7:30 comes around we inquire about our table only to be told that there was not a sitting space yet, which would be ok minus the fact that there were multiple tables open that we asked about.  7:45 we asked again and were told that they were setting up a table immediately.  8:10 comes around and we're still not seated so had to ask the hostess again, which apologized and sat us at the table we had asked about 40 minutes ago when our reservation time was.  It took 40 minutes to seat us at our table for our reservation time of 7:30 when there were tables open.\\n\\nIt was a frustrating experience because everyone was hungry and we weren't even offered bread sitting on their patio...  The frustration unfortunately set the mood for the dinner and although our food was great, we didn't really enjoy the time we had here. \\n\\nWe really wanted to love Alla Famiglia.  Perhaps we'll try one more time and hope our experience is better.\",\n",
       " 501: \"If you want one of the best, most authentic Italian dining experiences in the country then look no further than here. But bring your wallet. My girlfriend and I came here last weekend. To start off we got the meatball appetizer. (Which is more than enough to feed 4 people, we had to take it home and it is to die for) then they brought out a pasta dish with vodka sauce .(which is also to die for) and for the main course I had the cowboy steak Gorgonzola. Which absolutely changed my life. And my girl had the linguini del mare. Which she said was very good. This establishment is not only one of the best in the region, it's one of the best eating establishments in the country.

Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon, Brazilian Sausage, Parmesan crusted pork loin etc.    Our waitress did state to \"pace yourself\" but that was difficult to do because once you started to taste one selection - another one would arrive.   I had a tough time turning my little disk on our table to the \"red\" side -which halted any new meat from arriving.  We received two sides - garlic mashed potatoes and sweet grilled bananas (which are supposed to cleanse your pallet).  The mashed potatoes were tasty but the garlic was a bit too strong for my taste. The grilled bananas were different.      \\n\\nThe restaurant was busy and seemed as if our waitress was overwhelmed it took a little while for our drinks to arrive.

One for now, one for later.  The pulled pork was good, though I was surprised by the cheddar cheese sauce as opposed to sliced or shredded cheese on top.  The buffalo chicken sandwich, which I got with provolone instead of the cheddar cheese, was better in my opinion than the pulled pork.

I met a friend around 9pm on a Thursday night thinking we would have no problem with crowds.  Big mistake.  After squeezing my car into the last open parking spot within a 5 block radius, we made our way inside.  The place was packed.  I was hoping to lounge outside, enjoy a few drinks and the lovely weather, catch up on current events....it was not to be.  Instead we settled for one of the last tables inside.\\n\\nThe service, while not the quickest, wasn't a complete disappointment considering how busy the place was.  The chips and salsa were some of the best I've ever had - which they should be for the price.  We also ordered tacos - my friend got the mahi mahi tacos, I the hanger steak tacos.  $7.50 for just two tacos seemed a little steep, but they were darn good.  The beer and cocktail menu has lots of options.  One of our biggest likes was the music - lots of great songs I hadn't heard in awhile.\\n\\nI don't know that I was necessarily impressed with my whole Round Corner Cantina adventure, but I will probably be back.  Just not when I'm in a hurry.\",\n",

They make them fresh and delicious!  I can't get past how yummy they are, but the sangria is also rather refreshing.\\n\\nI've been to Las Velas several times and will continue to return.  I've experienced several menu items including the hanger steak tacos, mango chipotle chicken and a pork burrito.  The mango chicken was just okay.  I'm a fan of the hanger steak, so the tacos didn't have to try to hard to please me.  But they did anyway.  I most recently enjoyed the Xel-Ha Burrito with pork and this proved to be my best decision yet.\\n\\nI've had a seat at the bar but I prefer a table.  Grab a seat by the window and enjoy the entertainment of Market Square over some chips and salsa.  \\n\\nThe cost may seem a little high, but it's worth it.

Until I saw the offer, I had no idea they even had food options but after looking over the menu online, I couldn't wait to give it a try.  My Groupon quickly expiring, I was happy to treat my Mom when she asked if I was available for lunch.\\n\\nSugar Cafe is a  modest place, and rather quiet if you pop in on a Tuesday afternoon.  My Mom selected the steak sandwich with potato salad.  I had the roasted chicken sandwich with side salad.  The wait for our food seemed a bit long considering we were the only ones waiting for food at the time.  But our sandwiches were out of this world so I was willing to forgive the extended wait for the most part.  My side salad was fresh and the dressing was great, but I was jealous of my Mom's choice of potato salad once she gave me some to try.  I was glad to have the Groupon and while I was impressed with our food, it seemed a bit pricey.  However, the $2 charge for a bottomless cup of amazing local La Prima coffee is a steal.\\n\\nHaving filled up on sandwiches, we picked our desserts to go.  This is where my Mom was not as impressed, mostly because she asked for the chocolate chip scone and ended up with a chocolate chip cookie (but blamed herself for not checking the bag before we left).  I got a lemon cupcake that was delicious and refreshing - a good choice for a summer day.\\n\\nFriendly staff and good food made this a good choice.  I'm slowly learning that Dormont is full of great gems I have yet to discover.  Places like Sugar Cafe will keep me coming back.\",\n",
       " 535: \"If you're looking for a cool local place to hang and enjoy some good beers, Caliente is it.  Their beers, both bottled and on tap (including many local selections), rotate frequently so there's always a fresh selection.  I usually order a flight so I can try a few beers when it's too difficult to decide on just one or two.  The website is also updated regularly with the current draft and bottle list.  It's also good to know that they will fill any growler with almost any of their draft selections.\\n\\nCaliente offers daily food and drink specials in addition to their weekday happy hour specials.  The food isn't high class, but I'd say it's better than your average bar food.  I've thrown the kitchen a curve ball when I ordered fries with the special request that they be tossed in the garlic parm sauce used for wings and they delivered.  I've tried several of their other wing flavors (I prefer the boneless in the Blues Brothers sauce), the Italian and Steak subs, the gourmet pizzas and even a calzone (which they will warn you might take some extra time to bake but is well worth it).  I don't always go there to eat, but I end up smelling the food and at least order something to go most nights I'm there.  While everything I've had has been good, I would definitely recommend the gourmet pizzas before anything else.  (The Thai Chicken is definitely worth your time.)  I wouldn't recommend delivery but instead order take-out ahead of time.  Or go for a beer while you wait for your food. \\n\\nDon't forget to check out the downstairs bar, known as the Railsplitter Speakeasy.  It's got a different vibe than the upstairs bar which can feel a bit more divey and crowded.  The Railsplitter has a more cozy feel and I find it a better atmosphere for enjoying a good craft beer.  (If it was up to me, the whole place would look and feel like the Railsplitter.)\\n\\nI get some of the complaints, but on several of my own visits to Caliente, I find the problem is with the clientele.  In other words, people go in for a beer and then don't know what to do when they can't get a Bud Light.  These are the people who can ruin a good night for an otherwise great server.  \\n\\nJust remember if you're thinking about checking it out it's called Caliente PIZZA and DRAFT House.  And if you enjoy a great beer and a perfect slice, buy the crew a 6-pack as a thank you.\",\n",

It's no secret that I'm a sandwich lover so I was eager to give this place a try.  During my first visit I learned that they have Pennsylvania Dutch Birch Beer in their fountain which means I'm already in love before I've even tasted a sandwich. \\n\\nWith a name like Carhops, it's no surprise that the sandwiches are named after cars.  I haven't tried them all (yet), but I've had the DeVille (cheesesteak), GTO (cheesesteak with bacon), Carhops Special Loaded (cold Italian) and the Super Sport (hot Italian).  The cheesesteak was good, but my favorite is definitely the Italian hoagies because of their hot peppers and relish.  Top a deliciously chewy baguette with some choice meats and cheese and those hot peppers and relish and you have yourself an unbeatable sandwich!  They are available in foot or two-foot long sizes.  I've seen the pizza slices and they look good but I have not yet tried them.\\n\\nTheir prices do seem a bit steep and their customer service can be hit or miss.

Dithridge Street from Fifth Ave and pull off to the left into the loading zone.  (You'll see the deli's window on the first floor to the left of the entrance.)  Enter Webster Hall at this entrance and you'll find Kevin's Deli to the left. \\n\\nI'm not sure how I first learned about Kevin's Deli, but I suspect it was one of the few reviews here on Yelp.  Shortly after, a Groupon became available so I jumped on the chance.  Not that the Groupon was necessary since Kevin's Deli is super-cheap.  Most items on the menu are $5 or less.  It's a bargain but well worth it.  Kevin knows what he's doing with the simple things.  Like the Turkey Bacon Club with fresh turkey and bread that is toasted to perfection.  I don't know where he gets his steak or what he does to it when he cooks it but I've had both the steak pita and the steak hoagie with fries and been amazed at how great it tastes.  I will be back to try some of the other items I've read are good.  Like the chicken salad, pasta salad or even that pound cake.  He also offers many breakfast items but I think most people go in for the lunch sandwiches.\\n\\nI suspect that most of his business comes from local businesses and college students.  Don't go late (Kevin's Deli closes at 4:30pm) or on the weekend (open Monday through Friday).  You may be confused because he operates out of a very small room that was likely someone's office at one time.  But if it's lunch time and you're in Oakland, you can't go wrong for the price.  Kevin's Deli may be small like the prices, but the taste is bigger than you'd expect.\",\n",
       " 538: \"This is the story of a girl.  A girl with a dream.  A dream about steak.\\n\\nA week before I had a random Wednesday-Thursday off, I decided that Thursday would be it.  The day I finally made my way to Gaucho.  Of course I've heard the hype.  Who in the Pittsburgh Yelpiverse hasn't?  Clearly at this point Gaucho is well established.  I didn't expect to be disappointed.  The question was just how happy could a lunch at Gaucho make me?\\n\\nI knew I had to do my research.  I drooled over the menu several times ahead of time trying to narrow down the choices so I wouldn't panic when I ordered.  I read several of the hundreds of Yelp reviews looking to learn the ins and outs of how to order (at the counter, take a seat and wait for your name to be called), when to arrive (since it seems to always be busy, often with a line out the door), how the service was (friendly) and what people thought of the food itself (amazing).  \\n\\nThe night before I had attended a Yelp Elite event at a local brewery.  I hit up three local breweries that day (it's kind of my thing) and came home with an IPA that I thought would pair well with the steak I was anticipating.  And then the waiting....\\n\\nI planned to arrive at Gaucho when they first opened at 11am.  I scored rock star parking just in front of their location.  I got out of my car and could immediately smell that wood fired grill. The outside patio was intriguing but it was a little muggy so I decided on dining inside.  I went to the corner entry door (don't be fooled by the two other doors that are not entrances for patrons) and made my way inside.\\n\\nThe inside is welcoming and the huge menu greets you as you approach the counter to place your order.  I was the first to arrive, but only long enough to place my order and pick my seat.  I kindly told the first girl who asked me if I wanted a drink that all I needed was a glass since I brought my own beer.  She happily obliged and the girl next to her took my order.  I went with the small skirt steak plate, medium.  I took my seat in a corner table so I could watch the magic behind the scenes.  I watched the efficient symphony of servers emerging from the kitchen, dancing through the dining room calling out names to deliver food to anticipating diners and clearing tables for incoming patrons while another employee transferred wood from the dining area to the grill in order to keep the fire going.  \\n\\nMy meal was delivered to me within 15 minutes and it was such a thing of beauty that it brought a tear to my eye.  I almost didn't want to eat this work of art.  Gaucho is simple but captivating with its presentation, in this case my medium skirt steak with chimmi, toast and salad.  I took my time to savor every bite and every angle.  I tried the 4 different sauces they had on the counter as well and liked them all, but found the meat did not need any extras.  Good steak like this stands on its own.  \\n\\nIt might seem questionable as to why I only gave 4 stars.  The overall experience of Gaucho is definitely not to be missed, don't get me wrong.  But I think I would have been confused about how and what to order if I hadn't prepared myself ahead of time.  I also think that despite the efficiency in service it can be disruptive when names are yelled out through the whole restaurant.  I guess what this really means is I'll have to go back again and try something else to see if I can have an even better experience.  Sigh.  If I must.\",\n",

Until you realize it's Mexican food which means 4 ingredients prepared 6 different ways.  I was on my way home so I wanted something easy to transport that wouldn't be soggy by the time I sat down to eat it.  My eyes perked up when I saw flank steak as a meat option and went right for that on a burrito with chunky salsa.  \\n\\nI think what made the Las Chicas burrito stand out was the use of Spanish rice.  It adds more flavor than your boring white rice and it was executed well.  The steak was also nice and tender and along with the chunky salsa I selected, it was a good burrito.  I wanted it to be bigger to satisfy my appetite (and justify the price).  \\n\\nI'd have to say I won't go out of my way to seek them out.

       " 540: \"*Please note: Draai Laag Brewing's taproom was previously known as Saints and Turncoats Public House (I've included some of my original review comments here along with some new observations).  More reviews can be found under the old listing and the info about the beer and location are comparable.  It should also be noted that the address is confusing because it's on East Ohio Street in Millvale.  The building is relatively plain and the sign, unless you're really looking for it, is small in relation to the building and not well lit.  When you do find the location, it seems unclear if you can park in front of the building or not (you can).  But if you can get over this initial confusion, it is more than worth it.\\n\\nAs with most local breweries, hours at Draai Laag are limited.  Currently they are only open Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  Since my first visit, the interior has changed slightly (the bar isn't up with those high chairs anymore and is now in a different location inside the taproom).  There are still several tables scattered with games and they've begun encouraging a weekly game night.  Still no televisions so don't go here expecting to watch a game.  Fair warning, it's not that kind of bar.\\n\\nI think I preferred the original taproom over the renovation.  The new Draai Laag is still a good place to meet old friends and make new friends.  Also on the positive side, they have upped the food game with the addition of Black Shepherd Farms on Fridays (menu changes weekly but I stopped in for the stuffed flank steak and was not disappointed) and food trucks on a regular basis.\\n\\nThe draft selection rotates through their list of beers with several others available in bottles to go.  If you like Belgian brews, you will like just about anything at Draai Laag (my personal favorite being the Simon Girty).  ABV in most of their beers is a little higher and as expected the cost of a drink has increased to around $6-$7.  Flights are still offered for those who want to try a variety.  Their briars are popular with fans of sour beers.  I haven't tried all their beers, but I'd recommend the Goedenacht to anyone who likes farmhouse ales.  \\n\\nI recommend following their Facebook page for updates on what beers are available (especially if you have a favorite since all beers aren't always available) and any food trucks or events planned.\",\n",

This museum was not only a huge part of my daughters' childhoods with at least 1 visit every summer, our youngest daughter got married there. The Carnegie Museum will hold a special place in our hearts forever! \\n\\nThe basic exhibits have been there since I did my school field trips (a loooong time ago!) and there have always been special rotating ones to check out and enjoy over the years. What one doesn't stop long enough to realize as you're schlepping kids from place to place is the amazing architecture of the building itself. That's what became so apparent as the wedding was taking place. The murals all around the walls and ceiling of the grand staircase area where the ceremony was held are spectacular, as well as the marble columns and staircases themselves. I had never had the opportunity to stand there and take it all in until that moment and it's pretty mind blowing how gorgeous everything truly is. \\n\\nThe 2 typical places for social events at the museum are The Hall of Architecture, where our reception was held, or the Carnegie Music Hall. Both are amazing event sites. Parkhurst Dining does the catering for events at the museum. Yes, it's the catering division of Eat N Park which initially gave us pause until we did their tasting and from that point on we had no worries. They produced really spectacular food elevated far above what one considers typical banquet fare. Everyone raved about their steaks being perfectly cooked and everything arrived hot to the tables. Alice, the baker, did a phenomenal job on the wedding cake, too. I'm not even a cake person and have to say that Alice's chocolate cake with raspberries was killer! \\n\\nAll the Greek and Roman Facades in the Hall of Architecture had always given me goose bumps when I walked in there over the years.

The bleu cheese had no flavor, the bacon was barely noticeable and I had to add ketchup to it to get anything going on.

Dinner at Cioppino wasn't quite the same but Brielle's service provided just as much fun and she deserves kudos for that! Our calamari appetizer was tender and flavorful and is definitely something I'd order again although the romaine salad from the specials menu arrived pre-dressed and was a little heavy for my liking. I ordered the crab cakes and mac & cheese for my entree thinking I could do no wrong there. Unfortunately, the mac & cheese was almost dry and not chef worthy. The sauce under the crab cakes was very heavy and fatty tasting which didn't enhance the dish. The crab cakes themselves were very tasty with minimal filler and worthy of 4.5 stars. My husband ordered the Alaskan Halibut and he seemed pretty happy with his choice although he also couldn't help comparing our dinner here to Takashi either. The best part of our evening was topped off by Brielle yet again by providing a special anniversary dessert of their banana French toast with chocolate bacon on the side -very fun & innovative!

Average burgers, nothing exciting and seriously lacking in flavor with a side of chips that could have chipped a tooth.\\n\\nBased on the descriptions, it seems like they are trying. Just not succeeding. I ordered the What-A Jerk Chicken and hubby got the Morty's Steakhouse. Both sounded like they should have had flavor for days. I detected no jerk seasoning whatsoever on my chicken burger - which is actually ground chicken, not a chicken breast which was explained by our server before I ordered.

After reading a lot of the Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to the food and was concerned about the poor service many before us reviewed.\\n\\nWell as you may guess by the rating, neither the food or the service was up to par. In my opinion, one of the very best things a restaurant can do to ensure its success is to make sure their servers are knowledgeable, gracious, super efficient & personable. If I'd had that, I'd probably give the food another chance. \\n\\nThe most glaring failure during order taking was asking if we wanted bread or frites with our mussels and failing to mention when my husband said frites that he would again be served French fries with his brisket sandwich. Who seriously needs 2 orders of fries during 1 service? Our first beers we ordered off the bar menu were served in cans - that's an inexcusable restaurant decision that I wish they had made more obvious on that bar menu. Seriously, it's a gastropub not a tailgate!  Draft beers were not mentioned by our server and had we not read the board on the other side of the bar and done an online search for the beer's description, we wouldn't have known they existed or what they were. She had no idea about any of the drafts when we asked.\\n\\nSo many things on the menu were appealing we decided to order 4 items. We started with the smoked wings (recommended highly by other Yelpers) and the curry mussels. I got the feeling if we hadn't specified to our server that we considered the final 2 items to be our entrees, that all 4 items would have shown up at our ridiculously tiny table for 2 at once. When the 2 appetizers arrived at once we had to pile everything on top of each other because the table didn't have room for 2 appetizers plus 2 small appetizer plates. The wings were actually really delicious with a nice smokey flavor and turned out to be  the highlight of the meal. The mussels were nicely sized and plentiful but the curry sauce was sorely lacking in flavor. \\n\\nThen our server disappeared for 20 minutes, stopped by to tell us she was sorry about our wait but our food would be up in 1 minute, then disappeared for 25 additional minutes. My husband found her scurrying by long enough to tell her to please cancel the rest of our food if it wasn't already sitting in the back. She disappeared for another 5 minutes and appeared with only my husband's brisket sandwich which came with more frites. She squeezed into the tiny space between us & the next table and informed me that my short rib flatbread had hit the floor as she was racing it to our table but that they had started another one and it would be done in 7 minutes. Not sure why the first one couldn't come out in 45 if it only took 7 to cook. \\n\\nNeither the brisket nor the flatbread were very good and unfortunately our attitudes toward Meat & Potatoes weren't either by the end of the evening.\",\n",
       " 550: \"Four of us dined at Verde during Restaurant Week last week and Yay, I am indeed a fan! It's very cool and modern inside with tons of windows and a bar that lights up to reflect their amazing selections of tequila. I didn't realize this was Garfield until it popped up on Yelp. I would have guessed Friendship & I guess I was incorrect.\\n\\nI would consider this restaurant to be a high end, chef inspired Mexican restaurant with some really interesting flavors and menu options that elevates it beyond what one thinks of in a traditional Mexican restaurant. \\n\\nWe started with a pitcher of margaritas and all 4 of us got the Special Price Fixed Menu - 2 carnivores, 2 vegetarians and all of us had fun selections. The veggie girls got the corn appetizer and it looked and they both said tasted awesome and they swirled their corn repeatedly into their dipping sauces until none remained. We got the marinated mussels with lime, tomatilla salsa and cilantro. Served sans shells and those mussels didn't last long because they were delicious. Marinated to perfection with tons of flavor.\\n\\nEntrees for the girls were the Seitan Tacos and I thought they might lick their plates. Our Carne Asada was tequila marinated steak with cream corn and what I later discovered was a huitlacoche puree. Our waiter was kind enough to ask for me because I loved the black puree on my plate and had no idea what it was. It's a black fungus that grows on Mexican corn and they turn it into a tasty puree. Turns out it's used a lot in Mexican cuisine. \\n\\nWe all loved our Tres Leches Bread Pudding desserts with apricot rum puree and grilled peaches. It was so delicious and swirling it around in that sauce was amazing. My hubby said it was the best bread pudding he's ever had. He may be right! \\n\\nWould I return to Verde Mexican Kitchen & Cantina - in a heartbeat! In fact, can we go now?\",\n",

Clearly it was better late than never. \\n\\nI held off in the beginning because past experience with Argentinean restaurants had been underwhelming - typical seemed to always be piles upon piles of mediocre meat. Well I stand corrected! This isn't what they deliver at Gaucho. Here you get incredible flavors infused into their meat dishes with well thought out sides and enhancements also packing a punch for your taste buds. \\n\\nWe had the good fortune to sample 3 of their dishes at a Yelp Elite event held at The Pittsburgh Winery. The guys from Gaucho were memorable in personality and their food was absolutely unforgettable. \\n\\nI ordered their skirt steak which comes with a salad and bread at their restaurant the other day and honestly I may have to order it several more times before I'll be able to stray to other menu items. Yep, that perfect! \\nI have no idea how much effort goes into making that skirt steak taste this amazing but I know I certainly will be eating this again & again! It came served over mushrooms and onions that were also infused with all that flavor. Home run!\\n\\nIt's very obvious that the team who works here love what they do and their enthusiasm is pretty contagious. They are beyond thrilled that something they enjoy doing so much has been so well received by our city. They started off with such a small space that it's been tough to get in - another reason it took us so long to get here. Soon that will change when they expand their space next door. It's a classic success story: start small doing amazing food, crowds will come & you grow your business. \\n\\nWe will return to Gaucho & next time it won't take so long!\",\n",
       " 552: 'I spend a lot of time on the North Side, so I\\'d been meaning to try this place for a while. My boyfriend and I went in on a Tuesday around 7:30 PM, and we were the only people in the house. \\nThe food: \\nI tried a house special dish of the day - It was a blackened flank steak over penne with peppers, sun-dried tomatoes in a gorgonzola cream sauce. The dish was excellent, the right combination of sweet, salty, and savory, and the steak was on point. It came with a house salad that was a delicious blend of fresh greens with olives, peppers, tomatoes, the like. It also included grilled bread with a bottle of olive oil and Parmesan cheese for dipping. \\nMy boyfriend ordered the Veal Parm, it also tasted great, but it was nothing outstanding. \\nTuesday is there \"Greens and Beans\" for 99 cents special, so we also gave that a whirl. It was decent, lacked some flavor, but I wouldn\\'t order it again. \\nThe Staff: \\nService was excellent, our waitress was attentive and answered all of our dumb questions. You can also see the cooks making the good, all around they seemed pleasant. \\nThe Ambience:\\nWe were not aware this was an \"upscale\" Italian restaurant; from the vibe, the name, and the decor, you\\'d think standard Pittsburgh food. True to the name \"Legends\" the walls were lined with your staple Pittsburgh sports news clippings. The whole place was tiny, so the tables and chairs followed suit. I would by no means have minded the ambience of the food matched the theme- but it was a $20 average plate place, and I would have appreciated the vibe to match. They also placed terribly loud, out-of-date pop hits I could have lived without. Even silence would be better. \\n\\nAll around, the food was great, not excellent, but overpriced for the setting and ambience. I would recommend and I may go again.

       " 553: 'Having lived near this Atria\\'s location in the past, I can say that I\\'ve spent more than my fair share of time at the PNC Park Atria\\'s. My wife and I stopped in this past week, and for me, I was reminded of why I enjoy Atria\\'s...but this having been our first time at Atria\\'s together, and witnessing my wife\\'s experience, I realized why the place could garner such low reviews.\\n\\nFor someone like myself, who\\'s actually had enough positive and negative food experiences at Atria\\'s to know exactly what to order and what to steer clear of, I can make the experience a positive one, but that\\'s a situation I\\'m afforded now thanks to my previous patience and convenience. My wife, opting to stray from my suggestions had an awful dinner. Her plate of bland fish and asparagus left her turned off completely. Luckily, we were using a gift card, so it wasn\\'t as frustrating for her as it could\\'ve been. Regardless, walking away from an entire plate of food is disheartening.\\n\\nThat led me to realize this: If you\\'re only at Atria\\'s once, you\\'re odds aren\\'t that great of having a good experience. That\\'s just the reality of the situation. There are a handful of really good things on the menu that I LOVE. The parmesan crusted chicken is really good, although it can sometimes be a little too oily. The pot roast is excellent, but it\\'s way too heavy for most of the year...ESPECIALLY during baseball season when they\\'re busier. Their chili is really on-point...especially paired with their bread, and the salmon salad is excellent. Although, I don\\'t like the salmon, so I swap the salmon for chicken for a great salad option. The carrot cake is insanely good, but truth be told, it\\'s not homemade. I could care less, though, as it\\'s still some of the best carrot cake I\\'ve ever eaten. Period. Other notable items are the pot roast nachos, crab cakes, red skin smashed potatoes, and the reuben.\\n\\nThat\\'s really where the positives end, though. I\\'ve learned to steer clear of the burgers because of the inconsistency with which they\\'re prepared. I\\'ve received more undercooked burgers at Atria\\'s than any other restaurant, and it\\'s just not worth the gamble anymore. My filets have always been perfectly-prepared, but the one time I got a strip it was practically burned on one side and undercooked on the other. Failing to cook burgers and steaks correctly isn\\'t that surprising, but deciding to serve them to customers despite their incorrect preparation IS surprising...and poor.\\n\\nI know that the last time I had salmon on my salad, the fish tasted \"off\" and I paid the price for it later. I\\'ve never given a single fish meal a chance there since (we\\'re talking years now). Hence, my request for chicken on my salads now. Most of the meals that I\\'ve had are average, and I\\'ve practically tried the entirety of the menu over the years, so believe me when I say it.\\n\\nWhy do I continue to go? Well, because the few items that I do love, are crave-worthy, and having become a regular (less so, nowadays), the service that I received at the bar was always excellent. Daniel and Roy have always provided  great service to me, and good service goes the distance, as far I\\'m concerned, so it\\'s been worth stopping in from time-to-time. Unfortunately, if I can\\'t sit at the bar, I don\\'t always stick around, as the service at the tables is really hit-or-miss. For every good server they have, they have two more that could care less about their jobs...especially during peak times.\\n\\nRegardless, this is my favorite Atria\\'s location, because it\\'s the least \"stuffy\" and pretentious location of them all, but there\\'s still a lot of room to improve...and I hope it does.',\n",

It took me nearly six years of living in PIttsburgh, but I may have finally found that go-to, no-frills Italian restaurant that suits our laid back attitudes and selective palates.\\n\\nI\\'ve ran, biked, and driven past Big Jims over and over throughout the years, but never even realized it was there. It\\'s so unassuming and dive-y, that it\\'s easy to miss, but stopping in is definitely worth your time.\\n\\nWe\\'ve ordered takeout a few times and eaten in a few times already, and it\\'s never really disappointed. The staff has always been really attentive and nice when dining in, and takeout has always satisfied...even when they gave me the wrong hoagie once, it was delicious enough to forgive them.\\n\\nTheir chicken parm hoagies and dinner are both excellent, and the dinner is big enough to eat family-style. Good luck finding food in those portions, with that flavor, for under $11 somewhere else. The housemade Italian dressing is phenomenal, and should seriously be bottled and sold. We\\'ve only tried the white pizza so far, but it was delicious. I\\'ve had the Italian hoagie and cheese steak hoagie, as well. Both were good...although I used their Italian dressing on the Italian hoagie, which almost isn\\'t fair, since that stuff could make anything amazing.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a place to get a good hoagie, pizza, or simple Italian meal that\\'s so reasonably-priced you feel like you\\'re ripping Big Jim off, this is the place.',\n",
       " 555: \"I'm clearly in the minority based on so many positive reviews, but I'm not going to let that influence my review and overlook a completely average experience.\\n\\nMy wife and I went to Dish for our anniversary. I hadn't been there in quite a few years (mainly because I wasn't that impressed then, either), but it was time to give it another shot with so many of our friends continuing to rave about the food/experience.\\n\\nDish's atmosphere has a romantic, cozy feel, so it's a decent place for a date, but it's so tightly packed that you might want to be prepared for some intimacy with the tables around you. We were tucked in the corner, though, so it wasn't bad.\\n\\nOur server was nice, and her recommendation for our bottle of wine worked out well. She was attentive and did a good job of answering any questions that we had about the menu. No complaints there!\\n\\nAs far as the food, our meal started out well enough. We ordered the melanzane grigliate con mozzarella di bufala, which was excellent. The grilled eggplant was thinly sliced and perfectly cooked, and the balsamic/olive oil drizzle was delicious. We also ordered the beef carpaccio, which was perfectly serviceable. The appetizers had us optimistic heading into our main courses, but that optimism was quickly tempered.\\n\\nWe both opted for meat dishes, with my wife ordering the filet mignon, while I went with the pan roasted pork loin rolls stuffed with smoked mozzarella, speck and sage. My wife's steak was way undercooked, but considering we had just eaten carpaccio, that wasn't a huge deal for her. The bigger issue was the lack of flavor and the feeling that we could've made a better steak at home (that's the whole reason you go out, right? To have something that you CAN'T replicate or beat at home). Her side of mushroom risotto was a simple side that really didn't add anything to the plate in either presentation or taste. The other side of saut\\xc3\\xa9ed brussels sprouts - which we both had - was definitely the most memorable thing on her plate. Ouch.\\n\\nFor me, the pork loin rolls took a back seat to the side of gnocchi. Despite the excessive oiliness of the gnocchi, I thought the flavor and texture was excellent. The pork rolls seemed like a great idea, but the pork was too dry and overcooked. Oddly enough, while I'm not a huge brussels sprouts fan, they were really good.\\n\\nIn all, I wish I could say it was a $120 well spent, but I'd be a liar. We walked away highly disappointed and feeling like we made the wrong choice for our anniversary dinner. With Dish being 0-for-2 in my experiences, it's likely become a permanent afterthought for me. \\n\\nIf you're a Southsider, I can see the appeal, as it's a nice respite from the typical Southside scene. The intimate atmosphere is also promising, but if your meal was anything like ours, the food surely won't match the potential that the atmosphere creates upon entering Dish. I sincerely hope your experience(s) are better, as clearly most reviewers have nothing but positives to say. Good luck!\",\n",
       " 556: 'I have mixed feelings on Cioppino. On one hand, the space in all three parts (dining room, bar, and cigar room) is really nice and pretty welcoming. The crowd is a bit more dressy at times, but overall, the vibe is more relaxed that one would expect. I\\'ve also had some pretty delicious menu items in our handful of visits (the tomato-based crab bisque on our last visit being one of them), but I\\'ve also had plenty of average food, as well (the gnocchi, which was made in-house, but served with a bland mixture of ingredients and overwhelmed by the use of excessive broccoli rabe, for example). \\n\\nThey have a solid selection of wines and whisky, but the prices are a few dollars more than most places ($14 for a Balvenie Doublewood, for example, that\\'s typically $11-12/pour), and as I mentioned in a tip left here: Watch out when you order a whisky. If you order a scotch, expect a double automatically. Also, expect to pay for that unwarranted double when your bill arrives. Did you order your whisky \"neat?\" Expect a $2 upcharge. None of this will be explained to you when ordering, so just be prepared to pay 133% of what\\'s listed on the menu, plus $2 if ordered neat. Very strange approach, if you ask me, and I can\\'t imagine many patrons being as forgiving as us.\\n\\nWe\\'ve typically sat in the bar area, which was okay. The music can be a bit loud for casual conversation on Fridays. The jazz band is a decent trio/quartet...but not great. We\\'ve also done the cigar room experience, as well as the dining room experience. Both got the job done, but neither left us with any overly-positive impressions.\\n\\nSo, you can see a theme here. Cioppino is a place that tries to do a lot of things right, and certainly has the potential, but ultimately slips in nearly every area. For the price, there\\'s no excuse for falling short. Entree prices are high enough that a better experience can be had at numerous restaurants within a mile or so of Cioppino, if you\\'re looking in the $25-45 range. Want to experience overpriced whisky? There are places with better selections and experiences close by. I feel less guilty paying $36 for a single ounce of harder-to-find bourbon at, say, Butcher and the Rye, than $23 for a double (that I didn\\'t ask for) of run-of-the-mill scotch at Cioppino. \\n\\nWe have no plans on returning, but the fact that we kept giving the place a chance should say that we recognize the potential (not to mention our desire to have another good place near home), but we\\'ve left underwhelmed too many times. If they worked harder at improving the experience (and making sure their staff acts with some professionalism near the bar when they don\\'t think anyone is looking) instead of finding ways to inflate the check, we\\'d be able to recommend the place. As it is, save your money and time and explore some of the other excellent establishments Pittsburgh has at the moment.',\n",
       " 557: \"We love having a local butcher nearby like DJ's. The staff is awesome and their offerings are even better! The sausages that they make in-house are excellent. We've had the pumpkin sage, chicken chorizo, raspberry jalape\\xc3\\xb1o and chicken basil sausages. All worth trying. Our favorite is definitely the chicken chorizo, but it's often hard to get when we drop in closer to closing time. Fortunately, you can call in an order for pickup ahead of time if you know what you need and you're not going to make it in until later. We're actually huge fans of getting the chicken chorizo out of the casing and using it for things like tacos. It's awesome stuff, and highly recommended!\\n\\nWe've tried t-bones, ny strips, and filet mignon. You order your steaks by the width and they'll cut them to order. We also love that they'll cut the fat off of the meat, so you end up paying for mostly the quality meat, and not a bunch of scrap. \\n\\nSpeaking of paying, the prices are really good. Gerber's Amish chicken breasts are cheaper there than basically anywhere else that we get them. We typically stop in for all of our meat-based needs, but DJ's also offers milk and eggs from local farms for good prices, as well.\\n\\nWith a great, helpful staff, you definitely feel the neighborhood vibe of the shop. Just know that it's a small shop, so things can run out quickly. If you're looking to stock up on tailgating needs or even a few specific items, try to call ahead. Stopping in on a whim, or later in the day may leave you walking away without your favorite meats!\",\n",
       " 558: 'Considering this place just opened, our experience was excellent. It\\'s certainly a more accessible atmosphere and menu than its predecessor, The Original Fish Market, and definitely much more affordable. While I\\'ll miss a handful of the menu items from the OFM, as well as the larger array of sushi offerings, Bill\\'s is much more suited for economically-conscious visitors, convention goers, and really anyone unwilling to wait at some of the other, more established places downtown. There was plenty of staff on-hand and service was excellent. We were greeted by a nice hostess staff and manager, and once seated, had a wonderful experience with our waitress and the other staff that we interacted with. It certainly was a nice surprise based on some of the other reviews we had read. Perhaps we got lucky...perhaps others on here were unlucky. Either way, I have very little to complain about.\\n\\nWith many on here complaining about the high cost of a meal, I tend to disagree. I guess I\\'m just used to dropping $12+ on a burger, a la carte (a trend that\\'s growing in the area as places like Burgatory continue to raise the bar on both flavor and cost expectation), but their price points fall below other popular places in the Pittsburgh area, albeit for a slightly smaller patty (6oz, when most promote 8oz). I got the Fat Cat burger, and it was delicious. It was a basic, greasy burger with American cheese and caramelized onion on an English muffin. Simple, and well-prepared (medium is their go-to temp, but they\\'ll do whatever you prefer). The muffin was actually ideal for a greasy, medium burger. It didn\\'t get soggy at all (although, to be fair, I housed that thing in about 2 minutes, so I never gave it a chance). \\n\\nOur group ordered quite a bit from the menu. Aside from my Fat Cat, my wife got the steak & fries. The fries were, by far, the down side of the meal. A bit too soggy and undercooked. Her steak was delicious, but she orders similar meals at some other outstanding restaurants (Brewer\\'s Art in Baltimore or Eleven in PGH), and it wasn\\'t even close to on par with those places...especially not for the $25. The steak was really good, though. Her fries were honestly the only issue we had, though. The \"Frickles & Peppers\" were perfect and crunchy, with a hint of Old Bay to the batter. The vanilla shake was basic, but very good...so yummy, in fact, that I ended up starting AND ending my meal with one. For $5, it\\'s a heck of a shake. Their side of charred broccoli was tasty, and the sweet potato fries were absolutely PERFECT. I can usually limit my fry intake, but not this time. Perfect level of crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. If my wife\\'s fries were as perfect as the sweet potato fries, I\\'d have likely given Bill\\'s five stars.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s hard for me to be too critical, and I\\'m rating Bill\\'s on a curve. It\\'s not pretending to be fancy and I think the expectations set by the menu offerings and atmosphere place it in that TGI Friday\\'s-level of expectations, only much better. We\\'ve been to so many places that delivered way worse experiences days after opening that I\\'m confident Bill\\'s can succeed and only get better. With a pleasant and attentive staff, simple, well-executed menu, and - in my opinion - fair prices in a downtown restaurant scene that\\'s continually getting more expensive, I\\'m oddly excited to return. Walking by this place every day means we\\'ll either get to see it improve or worsen, but regardless, they\\'ve proven it\\'s worth revisiting very soon! Check it out!\\n\\nEnjoy!',\n",

I also enjoyed one of their 3 flavors of mussels of the day, a beer and mustard green concoction with chunks of bacon. The bacon soaked the beer flavoring up and tasted potent!  The broth left after devouring the muscles was the consistency of a soup. The server brought me garlic bread to dip in it. This place does have coat check which helps to save space at the tables.

Reminding me a bit of ginger ale (YUM!). \\n\\nThere was no air conditioning and we both were sweating in the tight crowded dinning room before we even got our entree.

I than decided on the Atria combo which had andouille sausage, Perogies, Chicken and Sauerkraut. I figured that this would be something different. The sausage was great and so were the perogies. I did not care for the chicken too much. It was dark meat with bread crumbs. I prefer white meat so that was probably the reason. I also tasted my friends steak  hoagie. I am from the area so I have had better. It was a little dry and not enough cheese and onions. The outdoors ambiance was great! Pittsburgh has a great downtown. Nothing like Detroit.

Well no. But for the highly affordable prices, the food is pretty exceptional. Between us our order spanned an XL pepperoni pizza, a personal cheese pizza, barbecue (6) and buffalo style (12) wings, cheese/bacon fries, and a half steak/cheese/mushroom hoagie (which was huge, light on the meat though) and only ran us about $40.

We had to place our empty dishes and drinks on an unoccupied table as she never came to check on us or move anything out of the way. Our food was served sporadically, which was fine, but she never made any kind of note to us that anything we were still waiting on was on its way or that it wasn\\'t forgotten about. She never came to check if we needed anything or if we were enjoying anything, only to bring more food, which she would hold until we took it from her.

I pointed to the back where I remembered it being, but as he was making his way there he passed our server and asked where it was so that he could be sure. We heard him ask clearly but she completely ignored him and literally all she had to do was turn around and point at a door that was a few feet away. Overall she just didn\\'t seem very friendly or engaging, it was like the fact that we came in to give her our business was a nuisance.

Why are all the teams I love in the damn AFC?\\n\\nNow that I've seen every NFL team play live & been to every NFL stadium (current and former), time to review them on Yelp! I love stadiums! I've been to every cool stadium in the UK & North America, due to my obsession with travel & sport. I've toured America as a musician for 7 years. In that time, I've seen sports games at (or visited when empty, or both) almost every major stadium in US and Canada. I have pictures of most which I'll upload at some point. Also, on future travels, I plan to take new pix, and add more stadia! Watch this space!\\n\\n***back to regular review***\\n\\nI love:\\n\\nThe black and gold\\nBig Ben\\nHines Ward\\nAll the receivers past (Holmes, Burress, Antwaan Randle El)\\nKordell, even. Maybe Tommy Maddox\\nTROY POLAMOLU\\nBILL COWHER\\nI like the new coach too. I know he's been around years. Tomlin.\\nI liked Kendrell Bell.\\n\\nI love the colors, they are sexy colors. Maybe I think they're sexy because Pittsburgh girls are sexy, and almost always wear black and gold. I've never seen so much of a city wearing the same team colors, it's awesome. Did I mention I love Pittsburgh girls.\\n\\nI love the University. I nearly went there but then got a free ride elsewhere. I love the Cathedral Of Learning. I love the city, it's incredible. I love the stadium.\\n\\nYou could do a little to be a little more friendly, but then I could say the same about NYC or Philly or even Buffalo. Oh and you have some amazeballs food here. And the view from the West End is just spectacular. You can see the stadium and everything, it's stunning. I love going up there, night or day. Amazing views all over the city. Cool glass castle. And so on.\\n\\nI love all the trick plays you guys would run on your amazing Superbowl runs.\\n\\nOK enough.\\n\\nIf you want good food in Pitt try these:\\n\\nMike and Tony's Gyro\\nMorty's Steakhouse Burger from Burgatory and their shakes too\\nTacos from outside Las Palmas on Brookline\\nPizza from Fioris Pizzaria\\nBluberry Pancakes from Pamela's P & G Diner\\nAnything from Kelly O's\\nChocolate Malt w/Caramel shake and Fresh Lemonade from Handel's\\nCoconut shake from there too\\n\\nThat's all I can remember for now.\\n\\nBut if you ever go down a mine and there are insects, don't worry.

       " 570: 'I am currently a Manta Ray. I float around like a carpet or an oversized kite on the ocean floor. But before I was a Manta Ray, I\\'d come here for sandwiches, often. Remember, I\\'m talking about Pre-Manta. ;)\\n\\nFirst hand experience:\\n\\nI\\'ve been to this Primanti\\'s maybe 7 times, including the first time I was ever playing shows in Pitt, and then the next 2-3 times because I didn\\'t know any better, and then I\\'ve taken some friends here including a barbie doll girl not too long ago. None of my guests were any more impressed by it than myself, so I\\'m sticking with a 4 star, sorry all.\\n\\nTheir food is just... it is good, it\\'s just not amazing... I dunno. i don\\'t get it. I do like it but there is something missing. It\\'s a Pitt legend though. Don\\'t ask them what the best seller is. The Cheesesteak is the #2 seller. Always get an egg on top of your sandwich.\\n\\nAn update on this to tell you that, while this isn\\'t the friendliest place in the world, there is a kind of charm to their abrasiveness that makes you feel like you\\'re at home. They don\\'t seem to like you using the bathroom (it\\'s in a nightspot, go figure). The great thing is that they are genuinely 24 hours and will make you anything at any time of day.\\n\\nI have to admit the food is a bit more bland than other local Pittsburghese specialties along similar lines (like Peppi\\'s). Having said that, I would recommend that everyone and their mother try eating there at least once, for three reasons. (1) It\\'s the most famous eatery in Pitt. (2) A lot of people swear by it, so you might love it even though I don\\'t. And (3) there is absolutely nothing in the world I have ever tried, that is similar to Primanti\\'s sandwiches. They are, for lack of a better phrase, an entity unto themselves.\\n\\nAnother sticking point I have is the price. It\\'s just too high for what it is and how busy they are. But then again, you do get a whole ton of food.\\n\\nThe only thing weirder than Primanti Bros, is that there is a Primanti Bros outside Pittsburgh. There are actually several, and they\\'re all... yes, you guessed it. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I know, I know, that sounds weird. But look at it this way. If you had to pick ten large cities in America that did not have their own \"local\" flavour of food, Ft. Laud might be one of them, right? And if you had to guess where all the hot Italians in Pittsburgh go when they want to lay on a beach and get warm, you might guess Ft. Laud right? Well, perhaps that explains it then. Except that Primanti Bros is now not only the famous late night eatery in Pittsburgh.... it is also the most famous in Ft. Laud!\\n\\nPlus the Ft Laud version has better scenery in all sorts of ways. To be honest Pittsburgh girls are probably as gorgeous as South Florida girls (probably the same girls on vacation?), but the difference is they\\'re wearing different outfits because the weather is different... you might say. And the Ft Laud location is literally across from the beach. The very same beach that, on my first ever visit to Ft. Laud, I had an intimate encounter on, with a lovely girl. I got a ticket from the police during that encounter, but not for making love... for leaving the car parked illegally at 3am while going down onto the beach to do aforementioned activity. Sorry, was that too much information?\\n\\nHowever, whereas in Pittsburgh I\\'d say, give it a try (the sandwich, not the sex, although that could be fun too)... if you\\'re in Ft. Laud, do yourself a favour... drive to Miami, and try what is undeniably the best Cuban food in the United States... See my top lists for more on that.\\n\\nPS\\nI don\\'t think Primanti\\'s Permeate\\'s my fave sandwiches list. For that reason I\\'m renaming it Permeate\\'s. And if you come in here when all the Pitt frat boys are drunk, then it\\'s more like P*nis\\'s. Or perhas Pre-Pubescent\\'s. In terms of levels of maturity anyway.\\n\\nStill, it\\'s better than The O - Original Hot Dog Shop. Don\\'t read my review for that place. Trust me.',\n",

Either what type of season they are having or the great players from yesteryear and now that has made this team part of the city of champions.\\n\\nWhile it is true the Pirates are currently on a losing steak which we had suffered for 19 years straight until the last couple of seasons, there were years when we hoisted the World Series pennant and have some of our greatest players in the Baseball hall of fame.\\n\\nI began watching the Pirates in my early years when they played at Forbes Field and later Three Rivers stadium both of which are now demolished.

They do have a special lunch menu and as I was pursuing a cheesesteak sandwich my waitress came and told me they were best known for their hamburgers.\\n\\nShe told me that they have butcher who comes in daily and grinds fresh meat for the burgers. The staff then fire the meat on a wood burned grill. I saw that each burger was 1/2 pound and felt that would be too much to eat. She told me I could order the kid\\'s portion for $1.00 less and would get 1/4 pound. It would come with the same sides they offer. Basic additions such as lettuce tomato, onion, and mustard come at no additional charge but if you want to prepare your burger to represent one of the ones on the menu then there is a slight upcharge.\\n\\nI was in a room surrounded by pretty artwork and overlooking an outdoor eating area for better and warmer days. I had my food in no time at the sound of the \"bell\" which alerts the waitress  that the food is prepared. I ordered mine medium well and it came out as such.

The burger was very good and very messy so I\\'m glad I ordered extra napkins. \\n\\nI got to chatting with folks at the next table. The lady there told me this restaurant gets their bread from the Allegro Hearth bakery in Squirrel Hill where I had previously been. Her friend ordered what they call the breakfast burger. It comes with bacon and a fried egg on top. He told me he loves the sandwich that way. He had never eaten here so I politely asked him what he thought of his sandwich. He told me it was to die for!  I did observe the larger portion and realized there would be no way I could finish it so I\\'m glad I had the option of ordering the smaller burger. It was just enough for me.

Most menu items comes with a choice of two sides. My son had the steak bistro sandwich, and my daughter had the turkey club. Course they serve you plenty of bread as well so if you can't finish it there's always the doggie bag. \\n\\nMy chicken parmesan was moist and tender and I loved the sauce that went with it.

I'll visit Cains again, but either won't go when there's a bouncer on duty (which is a ridiculous thing to have to do); or request a table away from the door and annoy the hostess.

As far as awesome thai food goes, I give this place 3 stars because it was truly \"A-OK.\"  Good prices, nice selection, okay food.  \\n\\nI ordered the Thai Me Up Rolls, as I can NEVER turn down a fresh spring roll.  They were fine, but this is no Tram\\'s Kitchen (best.ever.).  I also ordered the Salmon Salad; a bed of iceberg topped with a few pieces of slightly overdone salmon.  My crew of seven ordered a variety of soups, pad thai and fried rices.  All seemed a-ok.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is lovely and it\\'s BYOB (with a few corkage charges, etc - no biggie).

In practice, at least at the Southside location, it was pretty underwhelming.  My party of two arrived just after 6pm on a Monday to a mostly empty restaurant.  Our friendly server approached within a few minutes, but the time in between drink order...drink...meal...check was lengthy to say the least. Not a huge deal, but what is a huge deal is that the mussels I ordered were awful. At $7 I wouldn't usually complain, but that was exactly $6 too much (I'll give $1 for the half-slice of bread). For those of you that have had gross mussels they're the WORST. I expected more from a seafood restaurant.  Bummer.\",\n",

It's been ages since Nine on Nine opened its beautiful doors, and today was my first visit. \\n\\nUpon entering my trio was met with a warm smile by the host who quickly seated us in the nicely appointed dining room.  The Friday sunlight was nicely filtered through Nine's modern drapery, creating an ambiance that took us far away from Penn Avenue and into a quiet, peaceful utopia.  Maybe a LITTLE dramatic, but you get it. Nice place.  We were quickly presented with their Lenten lunch menu, which was full of many culinary delights including various types of fish sandwiches and entrees from tofu to steak - something for everyone. I ordered the Fish Tacos and swear that it's the best decision I've made yet this year.  Three large [soft] tacos were presented to me in no time; bursting with well-seasoned tilapia, cabbage, fresh jalapenos, avocado and a side of sweet thai/chili sauce.  It was love at first bite.  At $16, the dish is a little more than I'd generally spend for lunch, but well worth every penny.  My co-workers ordered fish tacos and the Steak Salad respectively; and none were disappointed in the least. From the service to the sweet chili sauce, Nine on Nine is at least 9 stars in my book.\",\n",

My mum ordered the fajita salad with steak and was equally impressed with hers. \\n\\nSo - BYOB, amazing food and delightful/fast service.  I'm not sure what else to say.

Those Yelpers really know what they're talking about. This bread was more like a fine steak; sliced thick and cooked to perfection. Served with a trio of condiments, including apple butter and the sweetest butter you've ever tasted, this orgasmic appetizer kicked our meal off to a tremendous start.  For my entr\\xc3\\xa9e, I ordered the evening's special; pan-seared Grouper with a side of pistachio puree, artichokes and beans.  I loathe beans (First world problems), but the chef was kind enough to substitute spaghetti squash instead. From first bite, I was in love.  The Grouper was PERFECT as was each of the sides on which it lay atop.  Jonathan had the prime rib and seemed pretty happy with his choice. But given that I'm encouraging him to Yelp more, I'll leave it at that.\",\n",

I met a group of 9 for dinner at 131 where we wined and dined the night away on several appetizer bowls of their Crispy Brussel Sprouts, a variety of entrees including Salmon, Paella and Flank Steak and a few salad/flatbread combinations. I selected the 131 Salad and the Tomato Jam flatbread. Neither disappointed. A good side salad can be hard to find, but this one was delicious and full of fresh ingredients including peppers and pears. I wasn't starving, so I only ate half of my flatbread, but it was a wonderful half. Two other guests tried the two other flatbreads and they looked equally exquisite. I didn't hear any complaints aside from a maybe less-than-perfect paella, but all told everyone enjoyed their food. The service is a touch on the slower side, so something to remember when planning your evening - especially if you're dining in a larger group or heading across the street to the theater.

The d\\xc3\\xa9cor can best be described as a modern/retro feel where the sounds of \"Mad Men\" can be heard alongside the clickety-clacks of \"The Devil Wears Prada.\"  In any case, I like it.  Fortunately, my lunch matched the impressive interior, as did the incredible service provided by a server with a smile so wide I feared for her facial muscles.  I ordered the Cauliflower Sandwich and my guest enjoyed the Crab Shells & Cheese.  What exactly is a Cauliflower Sandwich, you ask?  This cauliflower sandwich (as if I\\'ve ever had another) was comprised of a thick steak of a cauliflower head, sliced in half, roasted to perfect and smothered in pesto and hummus on grilled bread.  For $12 including a healthy portion of greens, I couldn\\'t complain. You can throw down $12 at Au Bon Pain and enjoy half the quality of this artisanal delight.  \\n\\nDon your Sunday best and give The Commoner a try, where the food, ambiance and service are anything but common.',\n",

What I heard was true after dining here- food is really good, service leaves a lot to be desired. Two of us were the first to arrive for a party of six. We waited a good 10 minutes at the \"please wait to be seated sign\". No one even acknowledged us standing there until two other members of our party finally arrived. They were semi busy but cleared out quickly since it was a 4:25 steelers game and several tables there looked like they were heading to the game. Anyways, a server came over about 5 minutes after we were sat. To get our drink order. She was pretty slow getting our drinks out to us. The other two members of our party arrived by then and when she came back she said the kitchen was running 30 minutes behind and we should order appetizers now if we wanted any. Ok so we ordered 6 old bay wings, 12 thai chili wings, and 2 orders of the cheese sticks. The cheese sticks were the best cheese sticks I have ever eaten! They are huge-3 to an order but these are so thick and gooey....and the marinara served with them is a sweeter marinara, it\\'s very good. I didn\\'t try the old bay wings but they were quickly devoured by the rest of the table. The Thai chili wings had a very nice sweeter flavor. And they were large wings too. Very tasty. She came to take our food order prior to our appetizers coming out. They did take awhile but she did warn us they were slow. Entrees came out quickly however. I had ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It had a horseradish BBQ sauce that sounded really interesting. The server came over halfway through the appetizers and said they ran out of the pulled pork. I was disappointed but I ordered a turkey Rachael with sweet potato waffle fries instead. The sandwich came on marble rye with coleslaw Swiss and thousand island. The fries weren\\'t great and we\\'re kind of soggy. The sandwich though was excellent. Real rotisserie turkey and lots of cold slaw which is how I like it. A steak and egg hoagie was ordered with chips-she said it was really good and it was huge portion wise. Another ordered the pastrami sandwich and another ordered the pastrami salmon blt. Both were said to be tasty. The quesadilla burger and the bacon and blue cheese burger were also ordered and were quickly eaten and said to be delicious . 4 of us took home half of our sandwiches - portions are huge! Our server didn\\'t check on us and it was us who had to flag he down for drinks. This is a great place to watch a game, lots of beers on tap, good food. Service needs to improve but I wll still come back again because the actual meal was tasty and priced right',\n",

We arrived around 7:30 and it wasn\\'t crowded so we took a couple of seats at the bar. Rose, the bartender, was quick to ask us what we wanted to drink. Of course I chose a Southern Tier 2X IPA and he chose a Yuengling, Rose knew all of her regulars and was friendly with everyone. The owners were actually sitting at the bar at the same time and seemed to know most of the regulars as well. For my meal, I ordered the getaway signature wrap (romaine lettuce, tomatoes, walnuts, diced chicken, mandarin oranges and feta cheese, drizzled with balsamic dressing). I asked for no walnuts and a nice surprise as well was the fact that there were craisins in the wrap too. With just the right amount of balsalmic spread throughout the wrap, this was very tasty. I chose fries as my side and those were good as well. My boyfriend has eaten here several times and said the wings (particularly the cajun) are tasty as is the quesadilla (which is so huge you can order just a half), and the Reuben, however, last night he chose the steak hoagie (Thin sliced grilled sirloin and provolone \\ncheese on a toasted 8\" hoagie roll with lettuce and tomatoes). He said it was tasty and he would order it again. Their desserts are from Signature desserts and they all looked delicious! We chose the pumpkin cheesecake. It had just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and was not overpowering. A very tasty seasonal treat! It\\'s hard to find a combination of good service and good food and we found it here so we will be back in the future.',\n",
       " 608: 'Thinking of places in the North Side to meet my friend at last night, I remembered the Modern Cafe on Western Avenue. I had a rather negative experience the last time I was here, which was probably at least six months ago, however, last night more than made up for the first time here! My friend and I arrived around 7:30 (just after happy hour ended-boo haha) and took the last two seats at the full bar, closest to the door. They also have a lot of tables beyond the bar, however, none of these were occupied. I never caught the bartender\\'s name, but she was awesome, very friendly and patient, particularly considering my friend and I chose to catch up for quite sometime before ordering any food. They have a good amount of craft beers on draft so I went with the Green Flash Soul Style IPA after the bartender had given me a taster of it. Green flash in general is one of my favorite breweries and this totally hit the spot! My friend went for his usual Yuengling. After scanning the menu, we decided to split the Mediterranean layer dip (Hummus, diced tomatoes, kalamata olives, cucumbers and topped with feta cheese. Served with warm pita chips) and the Spartan sandwich (Steak, Gyro meat, Provolone & Feta cheese, onions, tomato slices with our special steak seasoning & dressing topped with tzatziki sauce on a 6\" hoagie). The dip came out first and it was a HUGE portion for $8.99! It was really good and filled with all the good stuff, namely feta and olives-YUM! The pita also was grilled and warm when it was served. The sandwich, which was split for us back in the kitchen (without having to ask which was nice), was ginormous and both of us agreed we would not have been able to go it alone and actually finish it. My half had a lot of sauce on it, which is exactly how I prefer my gyros, and you could taste all the flavoring of the feta too. The meat was slightly dry but when paired with the sauce, it tasted pretty good. Since I live relatively close, I\\'m always going to keep Modern Cafe in mind when I\\'m looking for something quick, particularly a good craft beer since the bartender said they rotate frequent;y.',\n",
       " 609: \"Mad Mex and I used to be very well acquainted, possibly too acquainted considering I spent two years living in an apartment above this specific Mad Mex location (both a blessing and a curse but I digress....) I have actually only eaten at this location a few times, but I have drank many more times here, and ordered a plethora of take out to the point where I think I have sampled 95% of the menu. After sampling the majority of the menu, I really can't complain. While it's hardly authentic Mexican food, the menu options are unique and typically flavorful. Portions are large enough to leave you satisfyingly full. My absolute favorite item to order is the Kristy's big sister's red velvet quesadilla (Marinated chicken, grilled zucchini, spicy spinach, pico de gallo and Jack cheese). It's (relatively) healthy And always allows for leftovers the next day. The Carnitas quesadilla (Pork braised in beer, garlic and ancho chili rolled up in a wheat tortilla with roasted green chilis and served with slaw, pico de gallo and Jack cheese) is another stellar option and packs a bit more of a punch when it comes to the spiciness of the dish. As weird as it may sound, the coleslaw actually tastes really good when put inside the quesadilla (don't judge lol). The thai curry burrito (grilled steak, chicken, shrimp, tofu or portobello, with toasted peanuts, pineapple and Thai curry sauce. Topped with bean sprouts. Sweet-n-sour slaw) is another interesting choice I'd recommend and it packs a punch flavor wise as well. The margaritas are amazing, as fellow Yelpers have already detailed. While it may not be the most authentic or best-tasting Mexican in Pittsburgh, it's still an A-OK option in my book!\",\n",
       " 610: \"My first time at Capital Grille was celebrating my brother's graduation from CMU , but my parents have been to other locations and have spoken highly of it. Due to the fact that one member of our party has a severe shellfish allergy and another member is on a very restrictive diet, we were unable to try any appetizers so we went straight to the entrees. Everyone except for myself ordered the bone-In Kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter. Only one person who ordered it is a coffee fan but it was enjoyed by everyone. I think it was priced around $50 and it was a truly massive piece of meat! Every single person who ordered this finished it and raved about how juicy and flavorful the cut of meat was that night. I ordered the sliced filet mignon with Cipollini Onions and Wild Mushrooms. My steak was prepared perfectly to a medium temp. I thought the steak and sauce however was greatly lacking flavor. I have honestly had more flavorful steaks cooked at home. So for $50, I don't believe this was worth the cost at all. For sides we were rather limited by the diners with restrictions but we ordered the mashed potatoes which were absolutely delicious (we should have ordered 2 sides for the 5 of us) and the asparagus which only 3 out of the 5 diners were able to eat. A nice Zin accompanied our steaks. We had a cake at home so again did not eat dessert. As far as special occasion meals go, If it were for me I'd have much rather dined at meat&Potatoes or Sienna Sulla Piazza or Restaurant Echo-something more adventurous and complex than a simple steakhouse, however our service was excellent and the conversation at the table was enjoyable so pair that with mediocre food, it was a decent evening.\",\n",

We were greeted quickly and water was immediately brought over. We placed our drink orders while we looked over the menu. Prices are high-this will not be an inexpensive evening out. I ordered the crab cakes with mac and cheese. The crab cakes had a lemony flavor and were served over a \"creamy cocktail\" sauce. They were tasty but I still prefer Sausalido\\'s crab cakes. The mac and cheese was meh. Something similar to farfalle pasta with a cheese sauce. Butcher and the Rye has superior mac and cheese. My date ordered the scallops with the lobster risotto. He said it was good and it must have been as he cleaned his plate. Now I did not see our bill but I saw the menu prices so I basically know how much it was and if I had to pay for this meal, it would have not been worth it to me. Much better places to eat at in the Strip and Pittsburgh in general that are superior in quality and less expensive.

We arrived a little early and our table wasn't ready yet so we sat on one of the couches in the lobby for a few minutes until we were taken back. The tables when you first walk in are a very tight squeeze, however, we were seated on the opposite side of the dining room, and I did not find the tables to be too tight together. We were not privy to our table neighbors conversations so there was a decent amount of space between each table. \\n\\nOur server was very efficient and attentive without being intrusive. She quickly got us water and let us peruse the drink menu a bit further.

They were very tasty and very strong, but I wasn't the one driving so bring it on! We started out with the Lobster mac and cheese. It was so creamy and the doritos crust really added a unique touch to the dish. There were several chunks of lobster mixed uniformly throughout. This was easily the best lobster mac I have had in quite some time, possibly ever! I totally wish I didn't have to share because I could have downed that dish in a few scoops just by myself, it was that good! The portion was a nice size as well, perfect for two. My boyfriend had the duck which was cooked PERFECTLY to a medium rare. It was melt in your mouth juicy, and I will absolutely order that dish on my next visit! I went with the short rib flatbread after reading rave reviews on that dish on Yelp. I was impressed-the bleu cheese was not overpowering and the short rib was so very tender and juicy. I liked the arugula on top as well-VERY tasty! I wanted to save room for dessert so I left one small piece behind.\\n\\nI was disappointed they ran out of the pot de creme and the chocolate smores dessert, however, they had a red velvet cookie cake that was TO DIE for! I'm not even a red velvet fan and I'd totally order this again, although I am hoping next time they don't run out of the chocolate pot de creme.

I ordered the organic curried potato taco with chipotle mango creama. The taco was overstuffed to the point I needed to eat it entirely with a fork. It was very tasty but far too spicy for me to finish. Luckily my dining partner loved the spice and happily finished it. My dining partner ordered the spicy jerk chicken taco with avocado cream. It was the decided favorite of the three we ordered. I ended up finishing this one. It was not spicy to me and the avocado cream blended nicely with the jerk seasoning. The final taco we ordered was the flank steak with brussel sprout kimchi. This was the least favorite but it was still very tasty and beats what you could get at most local mexican restaurants.

Although we became a party of 3, they easily accommodated us and we were seated directly beneath the antler chandelier. We all loved the rustic decor and the bourbon/whiskey wall behind the bar was very cool. We did not get a chance to go upstairs but I could see it somewhat and it looked mostly the same as the downstairs. We were greeted quickly, our drinks took longer than we\\'d have liked but the quality of the 2 cocktails quickly made up for that . We ordered a dogfishhead 60 minute, a manhattan, and a butcher sour (my drink of choice). The cocktail I enjoyed was nicely handcrafted and the manhattan was described as \"aces\"-so this is an excellent place to grab a unique cocktail. The features they had last night looked delicious (a burger with pork belly, a hangar steak with frites, a squash tasting, and a pasta) however we were told that they were out of all of the features. The three of us started with the pig candy-\"pork belly / apple kim chi / miso caramel / cilantro\"-it was very tasty but not enough for three people so I only had a small bite and let the other 2 in my party eat most of it. As for entrees, the pappardelle (braised rabbit / carrots / tomato / celery / parmesan), the shepherd\\'s pie (braised beef cheeks / creamed peas / carrots / bacon / potato foam), and the mac and cheese off of the small plate menu (taleggio / fontina / goat cheese / cheddar / parmesan). I did not try the pappardelle but that is what I would have ordered had I not ordered the mac and cheese. I was told it was well cooked with large noodles. I tried a bite of the shepherd\\'s pie-the beef cheeks were excellent and the potato foam was like nothing I had tasted before. it was more of a deconstructed shepherd\\'s pie with the potato foam covering the dish. The mac and cheese was off the charts yummy! It was very creamy and rich and was the perfect size to finish on my own. The top was toasted nicely and the crunchiness naturally meshed nicely with the creaminess of the cheese.

This restaurant reminds of me a similar restaurant in Los Angeles that Iron Chef Mario Batali owns, called Mozza.  I must say, the server kept making mistakes with our food and brought out things that we didn't order, but that wasn't a big deal.  We loved this place and can't wait to go back.\",\n",
       " 626: \"I've only been here once (yesterday) for breakfast.  I noticed that this place opens really early (6am) on weekdays so I had thought it would be a nice idea to get down to the Dor-Stop on our way out of Pittsburgh.\\n\\nI was able to find parking on the street and the meters don't take effect until after 8am.  We had arrived around 7:35 so I figured we'd have enough time before I had to feed the meter.\\n\\nThere was only 2 other customers at the bar when we arrived.  We had our choice of seating and we had chosen to sit near the window.  Coffee up and ordered and our server was back consistently to make sure our coffees were filled.  On the table we noticed they had non dairy creamer and since both my wife and I aren't fans of non dairy creamer we had asked if we could have a small serving of milk and our server brought that over right away.\\n\\nBeing our first time I had to go through the menu to see what I was wanting.  I didn't want to eat too much since I had to drive back home but I did find something of interest.  My wife usually gets steak and eggs but she didn't this time.  I had sort of wanted her to get that so I could have some steak but she went with the ham and eggs with German potato pancakes and white toast.  \\n\\nI had gone with the all American which was 1/3lb burger, eggs, and lyonese potatoes which is basically homefries with onions with toast.  I also ordered a side of bacon.  I noticed the side of bacon was 3.10 which is kind of a lot but they gave me probably 6 slices or more.  I'm used to only getting 3 or 4 slices usually.  \\n\\nWe didn't order anything that they could impress us with I suppose.  It's not like we went with an item like hotcakes or a skillet or anything like that just a relatively conservative breakfast.  I did have some of my wife's potato pancakes and ham and they were both very good.  My breakfast was just as I expected nothing out of the ordinary but still very good.\",\n",
       " 627: \"I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory maybe 5 or 6 times now.  I love this place regardless that it's a chain because it's one of the higher quality bang for the buck type of restaurants.  This one's a bit different in that it's a standalone building in what seems to be the centerpiece of Southside Works with a mini water fountain type plaza in the front.\\n\\nWe came on a Sunday around 3:30pm this time around and there wasn't really a wait at all.  Originally we were just going to have dessert but I'm not really one for sweets so I ended up getting my favorite dish which is the hibachi steak.  \\n\\nThe Cheesecake Factory's menu is crazy and has a wide variety of things to choose from but as of late and for as often as we go I always seem to gravitate towards this same dish.  It looked a little different this time around as the steak although still sliced, wasn't scattered and was pretty much left as a whole.  The asparagus were smaller cut spears than previously which seemed to be about 2 or 3 whole spears tempura battered and fried.  The mashed potatoes seemed the same as before but with much more wasabi butter as usual which I did not mind at all.  The steak is sliced, with sprouts and mushrooms in a sugar and soy type of sauce.  Delicious!\\n\\nOverall this is my favorite dish and while I've had many at many Cheesecake Factories all over the continent this is still my fall back menu item and I love it.  Everybody that has ever had a taste of my dish it pretty much became their favorite dish too OR they said it was amazing.  \\n\\nThe service at this particular Cheesecake and pretty much all for that matter is always great.  The floor here much like many I've been to before as well seems slippery, greasy or whatever.  I don't know what it is but if you have deck shoes here it could be dangerous!  \\n\\nThey pretty much all have the same decor and lighting, the foods basically all the same and so is the service.  Still as good as it gets for medium priced sit down chains and I'm looking forward to when they finally come up to Toronto in the near future.  \\n\\nWifi would be nice considering people come from all over to eat here and the place is large.\",\n",

I had made a reservation using the Yelp reservation system and I was sent a reminder via email and the restaurant had my reservation in their system when we arrived.  \\n\\nThis is a classy place and upon entry noticed there were already 2 large groups seated and being served.  The restaurant had a good vibe to it as well.\\n\\nIt took us a while to decide what we wanted but we started off with drinks first.\\n\\nI had ordered the fried calamari as well as prosciutto wrapped cantalope as apps.\\n\\nMy friends had decided to go with one of the specials which was a seafood risoto with a large shrimp (it was a giant!) as well as my other friend had the chicken.  I had ordered the rib steak medium rare.\\n\\nThe shrimp and risoto looked really good.  The shimp... must have been a prawn or something because it was the size of a lobster tail.  I've never seen a shrimp that large.  \\n\\nI had a piece of the chicken.  The sauce was amazing and the meat was nicely cooked as it was white meat yet moist.\\n\\nMy steak was absolutely fabulous.  It was medium rare but not dripping blood or anything.  It was a nice temperature too but perfectly cooked.  I usually get either medium or medium rare but this steak was just right.\\n\\nI didn't have desert but my friends went with the brownie and a mascarpone maple cheese cake.  \\n\\nThe quality of food and service is very good.  The night was a kind of night that is a special occasion because I don't get to see these friends very often since we live in different cities but they are very special to me and it was a nice place to have a nice dinner with people you care about.\",\n",

The odor of wood burning and meat can be experienced well down the street.\\n\\nYou know how smell and taste senses are tied together?  Yes, that...\\n\\nThe place is really tight inside.  There's only bar stool seating along the perimeter of the dining area and a table in the middle with sauces.  The set up can be a bit uncomfortable in a sense that everybody is facing a wall or outside and there are people waiting for their orders and or seats to open up.\\n\\nI was in line and my wife took the only 2 seats that were available for myself and her as I was in line waiting to order.  Another couple was ahead of me ordering their food and I wasn't sure if they were eating in or taking out.  Another person waiting around was waiting for his take out.  Well after that couple ahead of had finished ordering they had nowhere to go just standing in the middle of the floor as all the stools were taken and some other customers that were done eating seemed to just be sitting around and talking and not really making room for new customers looking to have a seat and eat their food.\\n\\nI had ordered a chicken sandwich and a steak (rib eye) sandwich.  While the flavors of these sandwiches were absolutely amazing the steak we both had a hard time with (we split each sandwich in half and shared each).  The steak seemed to be really tough to bite through chew.  Don't get me wrong the taste was absolutely amazing but the meat seemed rather tough to bite and chew for rib eye.  The portions are very generous.  The amount of meat on these sandwiches are NOT skimped at all.  \\n\\nAlong with the sandwiches I had ordered a corn and the roasted potatoes (papas).  The potatoes were amazing but I really had to wait a while for them to cool off as they were really hot.\\n\\nI guess the tip for future is steak is good but not in a sandwich because it's juicy and the bread gets a little mushy and the meat is too hard to bite.  A plate that we can cut with a knife and fork would probably be better.  I'm not sure of the rib eye as the meat was generous and thick cut, the meat seemed less tender than I as expecting for rib eye steak.  \\n\\nIf it wasn't for the toughness of the steak sandwich I could easily grant 5 stars for Gaucho.  I would love to try the pork loin next time.\\n\\nFor the 2 sandwiches, potatoes, corn and one Limonata the bill came out to just under 29 bucks.

I asked if we could be seated in the corner area. She said that space is only open on weekends. She did apologize for the inconvenience and shared her empathy. However, instead of seating us back into the waiting area after waiting 10 minutes already, she could have said 'let me talk to a manager to see what I can do.' Now, perhaps this is my fault for not requesting a booth in the first place, but I was 38 weeks and tired. \\n\\nI understand they have this area blocked for a reasons unbeknownst to me, but one could clearly see a very pregnant in need of more comfortable seating.

The Swissvale Shroom is awesome mushroomy goodness, and I love the Popeye\\'s on a whole wheat crust.\\n\\nOne big warning: Service is wonky, especially if you order both pizza and sandwiches. The pizza kitchen is on a different schedule from the sandwich/dogs kitchen, and they make _no_ attempt to coordinate. Pizzas take 30 minutes and dogs take 10-15, so if you order a sandwich and your buddy orders a pizza, you\\'ll be finished eating before his food gets there. \\n\\nDown sides: \\n- The burgers are not very good.

I choose the Ginger-chili sauce to go with. \\n\\nThe combinations are endless. B.D Mongolian Grill has at least 10 meat options, even more veggie options and like 15 sauces and various spices.\\n\\nI am eager to get back here an try out even more combos.\\nOne downside is that if you are not very food savvy you can put together food combos that don't taste very good, or are too hot since the food is not professionally seasoned.  Even though the menu warns what sauces are very spicy, it can get very confusing since there are so many options.  I made mine some what spicy by adding additional red pepper flakes. \\n\\nThere are no formalities here, the cooks sing when they get a tip and the customer gets to hit a gong. The music is loud and the drinks are pricey and the restaurant has a college cafeteria feel, but I liked it.\",\n",

I recommend it to all my friends and any visitors to the area. \\n\\nThe place is tiny and so is the menu, but you will have an amazing dining experience if you follow the following recommendations:\\n\\nFirst, always make a reservation, especially in the winter.  In the warmer months, the best place to sit is outside, where they have several tables set up in a beautiful garden. There is a lovely fountain and pond in the back, where a few turtles play. I like turtles.  In the winter, indoor seating is limited to a handful of tables.  \\n\\nSecond, I recommend eating earlier in the evening.  Due to their galley-size kitchen, Du Jour sometimes runs out of ingredients for some of their dishes by late night. \\n\\nThird, bring plenty of cash and your choice of beer or wine. Did you know the former comes in pints? There's a $2 stem charge for each person in your party. \\n\\nLastly, bring a wizard with you when dining on the patio.  I know, I know.  Long have you desired to look upon the kings of old.  But you never travel through Argonath without some protection from orcs.  (Lost? See my picture). In all seriousness, make sure the waitstaff lights the candles because at some of the outdoor tables, bugs can be a nuisance. \\n\\nNow to the food. \\n\\nDu Jour has the best spinach dip in town.  If the place wasn't so tiny, I would go just to eat the dip.  It is served with freshly baked bread, so give it a minute to cool down before you tuck in or else you'll end up with burnt tastebuds.  \\n\\nAll of their standard entrees are excellent, especially the strip steak, salmon, and eggplant rolls.  But do try the daily specials!  If you and your fellow diners can't decide what to order, I recommend getting a few different entrees and splitting them up.  There's more than enough to share.  \\n\\nDon't leave without hearing their dessert offerings.  The flourless chocolate cake is especially good. \\n\\nCafe Du Jour is open Tuesday-Saturday 5pm-10pm.

Our food was turned around quickly and I enjoyed one of the best burgers I\\'ve ever had in Pittsburgh.  It was perfectly cooked (medium), and all of the toppings complimented each other. Moreover, it was a nice \"Goldilocks\" portion.

At $10 a pop I was expecting a nice juicy burger. What I got was dry and totally tasteless. The whole burger just tasted like nothing. Perhaps their salt shaker fell on the floor and rolled under the fridge or something tonight. It was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries. Again NO SALT OR SEASONING. For a $40 night out I really shouldn\\'t have to dump salt all over everything I order. \\n\\nThe service...meh. Our server was so meek I could barely hear her. Serving takes a bit of personality, no? When we asked what the happy hour specials were, she said \"Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....it depends on the drink.\" What? What does that mean? Basically it means you get a random discount on whatever you order, maybe, perhaps. There is no list, no standard \"$5.00 well drinks\" or anything normal like that. It\\'s basically \"order something and hope it\\'s on our happy hour specials.\"\\n\\nRather disappointed. They need to either lower their prices or kick it up a notch on the food and service.',\n",

The half rack is HUGE compared to some other places where I've tried ribs. The meat was tender and falling off the bone, and their barbecue sauce (I got the mild) was quite tasty...if they sell bottles I'm going to buy one. For the side dish I got the boiled redskin potatoes, which unfortunately are literally nothing more than boiled redskin potatoes -- no salt, pepper, butter, or seasoning of any sort. I'll remember that next time.\\n\\nHusband got the black and bleu burger, which he reported was good except the bun was too small. The service was fine, nothing special. The atmosphere was friendly and the place was busy but not crowded, which is a good sign in my book. The closeness of the tables to each other is a bit bothersome to me though.

Also, the table was too small to hold both the huge platter of meat and potatoes and plates, so we ate from the serving tray.

       " 709: 'What a great time we had... but credit goes to the company I\\'m lucky enough to keep, not so much to this particular Benihana location. Sooo... if you\\'re a fan of Teppanyaki, this review may ring familiar. If you\\'ve not done Teppan style before... consider this a sort of \"what to look for\" primer.\\n\\nThere were five of us, sharing our table with a very nice young, near-newlywed couple; May 2010. Our table wait time, without a reservation, was about 35 minutes or so. (maybe they were waiting for a newlywed couple to join us?). And what lengthened the wait was the understaffed bar. We waited nearly 10 minutes to see a bar-server, and another 15 minutes to get our drink order. While everyone was friendly and apologetic, even apologies get old when they\\'re used to salve away exceedingly slow service. Maybe the reason they appear to be busy, even on a Wednesday night.......? They had an abundance of tables celebrating \"Birthdays.\" I\\'d guess I listened to at least twelve renditions of \"Happy Birthday\", sung by the \"Greentree-Benihana-Bday Choir!\" (Oi vay...... next time I\\'m bringing earplugs!)   :-))\\n\\nMy impression? This is Pittsburgh; not my destination for \"great Japanese cuisine.\" So while this fine city certainly has some excellent eateries, when it comes to chain or franchised restaurants, you have to compare each location to the balance of their nation-wide organization. And having eaten at Teppan style restaurants for many years, and many Benihanas, I\\'d have to grade this particular location in the \"C\" range; very average.\\n\\nBefore we were seated, and while we were waiting in the bar, I spied the dining room. It appeared all the chefs were slow, seemingly ackward with their knives. And almost comically so. One Anglo chef, (no offense to Scandinavians that dream of becoming a Teppan-Guru), well, this guy looked like it was his first night, cutting off the shrimp tails...... almost one at a time, and still having a problem!? I think you get the idea. I\\'ve seen some Teppan-knife wielders, line up the shrimp and with one long swipe... de-tail-a-fy 30 with one stroke! Not here... some of the chefs may be on \"beginner knife-speed restriction?\"\\n\\nAs one reviewer mentioned; \"...it depends on which chef you get at your table.\" And with Teppanyaki style restaurants, and especially Benihanas, it\\'s very true. It shouldn\\'t be like that, but here in Greentree, and the evening we went, (Wednesday night around 630p), it was like going to a \"Barber College\" to get a free haircut, and trying to figure out how to judge the best out of a group of \"beginners.\" Our chef was possibly the best of the crowd, (sounds like... \"You have to go to my doctor, he\\'s the best!\"), but if compared to all the Benihanas I\\'ve visited, he too would be a C to C- level; maybe a \"brown belt\" in marshall arts vernacular? He did the \"flip shrimp tail into the hat and pocket trick\"..... finally making it on the third try. But he did smile throughout the demo. (A good attitude is worth allot in my book.)\\n\\nThe food? Pretty good. Essentially, we ordered \"everything on the right side of the menu\"... mainly because I was treating my customer service staff... the greatest asset I have for my sales region. And because one of them had never Teppanyak-eed, I made sure we tried everything! Sushi, lobster, filet steak, scallops, shrimp, calamari, chicken..... well, you get the idea. What with the added rice and vegetables, it was a \"belly-busting-feast.\" And again, because of the great company, we had a wonderful time.\\n\\nSo overall, I gave this restaurant 3-stars. It was the total experience. The food was good, and more important, the company was great. But as you can see from my comments, I felt like this particular Benihanas location was struggling to meet the corporate concept; trying to do it with Pittsburgh locals who, from the hosts to the bartending staff, to the chef and server staff, just seemed like misfits.

We only saw the name come up on our Verizon GPS, and we followed the instructions from the hotel, around the West side of the airport, and then East on Washington to the restaurant. I joked that if it had turned out to be like a Black Angus, or an Outback, I\\'d still be OK with making that our destination. We didn\\'t want to go wandering all over Phoenix looking for a steakhouse.\\n\\nIt\\'s a historical landmark building, and we saw both business people and locals doing dinner. I really think it\\'s what many of you guys call \"a hidden gem.\" I say that because the location is in a sorta\\' bleak, industrial portion of Washington, just North of the airport. So don\\'t go looking for a modern strip mall of fooderies. To me, the place looks more like the corporate offices for a rock quarry. But once you go past the copper clad double entry doors..... you\\'ll know you\\'re at a down home, upscale steakery!\\n\\nSo, my simple recommendation is this... if you\\'re in town like I am on business, this is a great place to take anyone! For the most part, steaks run around $30 to $45, depending on cut and size, and unless someone\\'s cut out your tongue, I\\'m pretty sure you\\'ll enjoy, or probably love your food! With a great bar and wine inventory, you\\'ll probably float around $50 per person with one drink. Add app\\'s and, well, the tab climbs a bit. And by the way, regarding your steaks... if you say \"rare\", then it\\'s rare. And if you say \"pink in the middle\"..... that\\'s what you\\'ll get! Again; well worth what we paid.',\n",
       " 711: 'Here\\'s another Italian restaurant getting one of my few 5-stars. We three, finishing a trade show at the Mandalay, visited Nora\\'s this past Saturday at 630p. It\\'s a huge success with locals, and was jammed. Many locals were at the counter picking up \"to go\" orders. I made reservations earlier in the day, and we were quickly seated.\\n\\nNora\\'s was recommended to me by \"The General\", (Irwin Raymer), known from Animal Planet\\'s hit \"Tanked.\" Irwin came to our booth at the trade show, and after a short chat, we exchanged \"deli and restaurant info\", with me getting the better end of the deal. He recommended Weiss\\'s for best NY Style  Deli, and Nora\\'s for best overall Italian.\\n\\nNora\\'s is in the strip center, NE corner of Flamingo and Jones, West of the Rio hotel. You\\'ll walk in the door, with the hostess station and kitchen straight ahead, the bar and one dining area on the right, and what I\\'d call the main-dining area on the left. We sat in the main dining area, against a wall in the NW corner. \\n\\nFor three, and because I wanted to get \"a flavor\" of Nora\\'s, we ordered with the intention of \"sharing until we burst!\" (actually, we didn\\'t intend to over-do-it... but the food was so incredibly good, and huge portions!) We started with the Antipasto Salad Large, and Steak Bruschetta. For our entrees, we ordered the Crazy Alfredo, Frutti de Mar, Chicken Marsala Linguini, and Oso Bucco. Best description would be... hearty, enjoyable, flavors.  \\n\\nWe also ordered indivdual glasses of wine and three desserts, which we also shared. The Cannoli, (the Sicilian pastry dessert, not to be confused with Cannelloni, the Italian large reed, cylindrical type of pasta generally served baked with a filling and covered by a sauce), was our favorite. The Tirimisu was very good, and the Cheesecake circle was good. But that\\'s splitting hairs... as the whole meal was one winning item after another. Our server was Brice, and it was with his guidance, and my instruction that we wanted to \"get a flavor of Nora\\'s\" that we feel expert now in working their menu. \\n\\nOver the years I\\'ve eaten at numerous strip restaurants in Vegas, but I much prefer the \"off the strip\" and privately owned restaurants, both for their more relaxed atmosphere, and their great food at reasonable prices. If Nora\\'s were in a strip hotel, I\\'d venture to say they\\'d be giving every other restaurant a run for their money. It\\'s that good! \\n\\nYou gotta\\' add this to your black book of \"off the strip\" Italian spots..... It\\'s a \"No-Brainer\"...........  \"Botta-Bing-Botta-Boom!\"',\n",

I had one of our customer service reps come from PA to help me do a show at the convention center. Our Wednesday night dinner needed to be logistically simple. I didn\\'t want to have to do reservations and then wait an inordinant amount of time to be seated. We took one of our clients with us, and we three \"did the Wynn buffet!\"\\n\\nIn short, the layout is similar to the Hilton Hotel buffet, and frankly, I remember the Hilton spread to have been more enjoyable. I was, sadly, underwhelmed. This is not a \"kick-ass\" great buffet, as some of us remember from the late 60\\'s and early to mid 70\\'s; Caesar\\'s Palace Showroom Buffet, or even the pretty decent Golden Nugget Buffet that Steve Wynn revived when he made his mark in Vegas...before he started with his strip properties. Those days, and those buffets, in my opinion, are long gone.\\n\\nFor me, the better food in Vegas is no longer at a buffet, but at some of the hotel restaurants, and certainly some off-strip restaurants. I\\'d rather revisit Vic and Anthony\\'s at the Golden Nugget, pay my \"half a hundred\", and get a great steak, than serve myself with OK, but certainly not great buffet meats and carbs.

However, it was a relaxing dining experience that included, as I remember, OK food. We got a nice booth in the back of the restaurant.

So outside of raving about the food, and what is usually very organized and pro-steakhouse service, I\\'d like to talk about two of my favorite things.....\\n\\nFirst, this restauraunt, although it\\'s crazy-popular, and located on the strip, is one of the easiest to drive to and park. There\\'s a small driveway at the South end of the forum shops off the strip. You pull in there, hand over your ride to the valet, and just walk into that South end entrance and \"wha-lah\"... Joe\\'s is right there on your left, across from the \"$75 Shave and Haircut Shoppe.\"\\n\\nMy second best thing about Joe\\'s? The KEY LIME PIE. I\\'ve visited Joe\\'s several times, usually when hosting clients from trade shows in which we\\'re participating. And every time, our small groups will start the ordering with drinks, (or carry them in from the bar). Then we\\'ll order one of the two large seafood layden appetizer trays, a few sides for our entrees, and then steaks and/or more seafood. But after it\\'s all done, there are two more items I look forward to. It\\'s my coffee and a huge slice of their Key Lime Pie! And if anyone thinks they might want a bite, or starts in with, \"Oh, I\\'m so full, I\\'ll just have a bite of yours\"... I order another slice for the table. (I don\\'t share! And these \"light eaters\" are usually first-timers that aren\\'t yet \"keylime addicts!\")\\n\\nAt Joe\\'s, with a party of 4, you\\'ll average about $75 to $150 per person with moderate wine choices. The food is very good to great, and the servers are all trained to a very high \"prime steakhouse level.\" I\\'ve almost always made reservations, and have always enjoyed the overall experience.',\n",
       " 715: 'All of my Vegas reviews come from business trips, expenses paid. So know that \"price isn\\'t the issue.\" I just want good food and service. And for me, it\\'s \"fair expectation.\" If I\\'m at a $30 to $50 entree restaurant, then my expectations are obviously higher than if I\\'m stopping at a fast food location. And if I\\'m taking clients to a $50 to $150 per person fooderie... than the entrees better reflect it. Unfortunately, this is about a specialty fish restaurant in a well known hotel that doesn\\'t deliver....... at least for me.\\n\\nBuzios, in Brasil, is a historical fishing village, known for great seafood. Buzios, the restaurant at the Rio, is under-whelming. My expectations were dashed against the rocks, and my vision of having an exceptional fish meal were never met. What the he** happened to Vegas? You either have to pay huge \"monies\" for a good meal in a superficially special location, or, well, I just don\\'t know anymore. This isn\\'t the Rio Hotel that I remember when they opened, and the current lack of \"excitement\" in the hotel has extended itself to Buzios.\\n\\nWe ordered the halibut, blackened. Best thing at the meal was my baked potato, smothered in those assorted grilled mushrooms. Those were my two sides. And unfortunately, the sides overshadowed the entree.\\n\\nHere in South Orange County, I can get a better fish meal at California Fish Grill in Foothill Ranch.... and for about $15. We paid about $30 per person at Buzios, and all I could do was shake my head in a sad sorta\\' way, wondering if the Rio Buffet might have had more fish for about the same $$$? Our halibut steak, as small as it was, just didn\\'t have flavor. I was expecting a thick, large steak. And I would have paid more for better.\\n\\nBuzios, at the Rio, is convenient if you\\'re staying there, don\\'t want to leave the property, and just want to get something to eat before going back to your room, or the casino. I wish I could be more \"excited\" about it. Sorry to say, I don\\'t yet have a great family style fish house in my \"Vegas black book.\" If you know of a place, let me know. I\\'ve taken clients to Joe\\'s Prime Steak at Ceasar\\'s Forum, but that runs me about $100 minimum per client every time I go, and I\\'m not always with clients.

       " 716: 'A most relaxing dining experience; there were five of us, myself, another company manager, and three members of an account from the Phoenix area. I had reservations at Texas de Brazil, not far from the Mandalay where we were staying, but unsuccessfully trying to get our 745p reservations moved up to 630p, one of our clients pulled out his Ipad, and through fate, we ended up at Twin Creeks. It was the best reservation goof-up ever, because our meal at TC was an unexpected joy. \\n\\nFirstly, we got one of their open booth-tables. It\\'s incredibly comfortable. You have a soft cushion with a leather lumbar support pillow... a dream if you have lower back issues... and two of us do! It wasn\\'t crowded at all, so it was quiet... and we could actually talk with our \"inside voices.\" And let me add this note... from the hostess up front, to our waiter and table staff, service was just how I like it... attentive, and that down-to-earth-formal that relaxes me, while at the same time makes me feel that \"they\\'ve got it all covered\", and I don\\'t have to worry about anything... just sit back and enjoy, which we did. \\n\\nTheir menu features high quality filets and select seafood items; filet mignons, NY strips, Prime Rib cuts, and more. We started with Ahi Tuna app\\'s, Oysters, Scallops, and their large specialty bread basket. It was \"all incredibly good.\" Our entrees and sides included 12 ounce filets, a 24 ounce Porterhouse, Huge Prime Rib, sides of mac n cheese, asparagus, baked potatoes, the most delicious mushrooms in a butter-wine sauce, and a variety of salads that were absolutely great. Try the \"chop chop iceburg lettuce salad\", as it\\'s got a remarkable vinegar dressing. \\n\\nI\\'ve boasted about Vic and Anthony\\'s at the Golden Nugget, but I must say that Twin Creeks has a new, and higher rating in my \"black book.\" It\\'s really a Vegas \"hidden gem.\" In the casino area of the Silverton Resort and Casino, I never, ever would have thought to come here for dinner. I always associated the smaller casino properties as being seedy and low end. Don\\'t think for a minute that the food and atmosphere at Twin Creeks is anything but \"super comfortable-high quality dining.\" This is my new \"favorite steak house\" in Vegas, and one that, evidently, not too many people know about. \\n\\nAnd oh.......... prices? About $25 to $45 for incredibly delicious steaks, and an average last night for us of about $55 per person..... with tip! Everything we ordered was excellent... period. I highly recommend TC..... and share this hidden gem on the \"QT.\" (don\\'t tell too many people as it may get crowed!)',\n",
       " 717: '(Up front apology..... this is a slight reworked review from others I\\'ve done on Brazilian BBQ\\'s in the Western states.) And know that I\\'d like to have given Texas a 3.75 stars if it existed, but have given the new Fogo in LV 4 stars, mainly for the meat quality. \\n\\nOur family is Brasilian. Here in Orange County, CA, we and our group of friends have tried just about every churrascaria that\\'s opened or is still open in the Southwest. Many of us, during business travels, have also had the opportunity to sample US based Brasilian BBQ both on the East and West Coasts, and some in-between places..........like Salt Lake City, UT. Restaurant reviews need a reference point, and Brasilian BBQ\\'s most especially.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, we\\'ve watched them come and go; some very good, some horrible. Yolie\\'s of Las Vegas, for example and IMHO, is on the \"horrible\" end. Problem with the Brasilian BBQ restaurants is their ability to be \"consistent.\" While good food is a necessity, the style of service, called \"Rodizio\", is critical. And well trained \"Gauchos\", or meat-servers, are usually the breakpoint as to whether a churracaria is going to be rated high. \\n\\nConsider that most reviewers have had limited exposure to traditional churrascarias. In Brasil a churracaria can be a contained in a bus stop - gas station area, or as a full-on up-scale stand-alone restaurant. Regardless of size or ambience, it\\'s primarily about the quality of the buffet, meats and the service. Example; \"The service here was excellent!\" That\\'s probably true and understandable if you\\'ve never had a server bring filet to your table, multiple times. But \"excellent service\" at a Brasilian churrascaria includes a gaucho-server that knows his meats, asks you for your perferences, knows how to pass your table and show what\\'s available without disturbing your eating. And again, they should be more than willing to help you with special requests.\\n\\nWhat you should expect from an excellent churrascaria is a hot and cold buffet style entree and salad bar. In Brazil, and at high end establishments, this includes high quality sushi and sashimi, and of course, rice, black beans and various vinigrettes and dressings. If you are a vegetarian, a great churrascaria should be able to keep you as full as your carnivor friends, with equal or better quality items. Service and food are usually what Brasilians speak of when chatting about their restaurant experience. It\\'s a three-point system. And properly rated, you would seperate them, rate them, and then total up the score.\\n\\nTraveling through the US, my opinion is that there are no \"great Brasilian BBQ\\'s.\" Fogo de Chao in Dallas-Ft. Worth, so far, is the best experience I\\'ve had, while their Beverly Hills location was very dissappointing. T de B is adequate, but definitely not \"great.\"  \\n\\nIf meat is your pleasure, then make sure to let the Gaucho-server and staff know your preferences. If you don\\'t want to waste time on chicken and bacon frufru items, then just tell your server to, for instance, just bring you \".....rare filet, tri-tip, called \"picanha\" (pee-cahn-ya), or whatever you prefer. If you aren\\'t getting rapid return service on the meats, then by all means, and because you\\'re paying for it, let them know. You shouldn\\'t have to, but if want to enjoy your meal, get that issue resolved early on.\\n\\nI\\'d say that Texas de Brazil is worth a moderate 3 star rating if compared to Fogo\\'s Dallas-FW location. It is certainly much closer to traditional churracaria than any of the LV Strip hotel restaurants. I\\'ve tried them all and was sorely disappointed. If you\\'re in the SoCal area, and close to John Wayne Airport, try Agora at Main and McArthur. If in the Long Beach area, a good \"blue collar\" consistently OK spot is Greenfield\\'s. \\n\\nIf you travel to Boston, Miami or the New Jersey areas, you\\'ll find larger populations of Brasilians and better food overall. Just don\\'t get too excited over Texas de Brazil. Yes, it\\'s way better than most other spots in town, but I promise......... there\\'s better.\\n\\nBTW..... most of the churracarias run a bit high on mixed drinks and also the desserts, but if they\\'re good, they\\'ve prepared them \"in house.\"',\n",
       " 718: 'Most of my hotel stays are for business. In this case, it was a trade show expo held over a Saturday and Sunday. I arrived Friday afternoon, and returned home Monday early.\\n\\nPhoenix was experiencing the tale end of summer. It was \"hundreds of degrees hot\" this past week. But the Sheraton came through as \"ultra-cool\", both with high marks for customer service and in their very generous and efficient air conditioning. We were actually commenting on the hallways of the hotel being \"chilly!\" We didn\\'t complain... we reveled in the \"in-house\" low temperature. \\n\\nI think everyone would agree, the Sheraton gets very high marks for their lobby, restaurant, bell hop, and valet staff. Everyone we encountered offered to help in a most comfortable way. I\\'m not a big fan of high-rise hotel facilities when I\\'m traveling on business, but when I do a trade show, proximity to the convention center or exhibit hall is huge. The Sheraton is a five minute walk to the center. Oh, almost forgot the beds... memory top mattresses; dreamy soft and contouring. And because the air conditioning grill is close to the window and blowing to the opposing wall of the where the bed is.... no sinus issues with \"direct air up the nostrils... another issue I have with high rise hotels.... air in my face while I sleep.\\n\\nCustomer service level means alot to me, so the relatively high cost for food and beverage, if you\\'re on expenses, makes it a wash. We ate in the District Restaurant, just off the lobby. My NY steak and halibut entree were both in the mid $20\\'s, and the portion size was \"gourmet small\", while the flavors were \"gourmet good.\" So if quality trumps quantity for you, you may like the in-house restaurant. If you\\'re doing breakfast, I\\'d recommend going across the street and a little West to the corner bakery place. We did breakfast the day we left for under $10 per person. The hotel buffet is a little over $20..... and I am not a big breakfast person, so it\\'s lost on me.\\n\\nSo... for high-rise, downtown hotels, I\\'d say a solid 4-stars.

But now, I have a very good alternative. And about those \"reasonable\" prices? Not as high as you might think. For our party of four, a couple cocktails and sodas, two appetizers, the NY strip, a bone-in Ribeye, a salmon entree, a chicken entree, three vegetable sides and a dessert we four split, our bill was about $250. That\\'s very reasonable for a steakhouse meal. \\n\\nFunny thing. When we had been seated for a bit, a group of four young guys came in, sat down, opened the menus........ and then in concert, stood up and walked out.

And even luckier, after driving into Phoenix around 630p, I was tired, but tired with an appetite. I lucked out..... fresh food, fair prices, and because I didn\\'t give in to the burger joints from Indio to Phoenix..... I had an appetite. And... PS is only a couple minutes from the Embassy Suites, Tempe.\\n\\nThis is a small shop, with a clean kitchen, and they cook everything to order! Don\\'t expect fast service (although it isn\\'t a long wait either)... because they\\'re cooking from scratch, so to speak. While the falafel mix is ready to go, they form your falafels, and then put them into the fryer. Your kabobs are cooked to order. The only thing that was already prepared was the lentile soup, which was excellent!\\n\\nFor a total of $24 with tax, I ordered the Combo Kabob Dinner with steak and chicken, rice, salad and soup, the 6 pc falafel appetizer, an \"abundantly filled\" gyro sandwich.

       " 721: 'You wanna\\' talk \"all you can eat Brasilian BBQ?\"...... Here\\'s my qualifier.\\n\\nOur family, on my wife\\'s side, is Brasilian. (In Brazil, it\\'s spelled with an \"s\"). Over the last 30 years or so, I\\'ve eaten at the most complete churracarias both in Brasil and here. And I\\'ve eaten at the most modest; including a churracaria in a gas station in Sul de Minas on the way to visit a coffee cooperative. (see my youtube video titled, \"Coffee Cupping in Sul de Minas.\") The defining/qualifying points are the same; quality and flavor of the meat, completeness of the salad bar, or \"bars\", (Some restaurants have a full sushi bar, with chef!), and quality of service. . So trying to remain both objective and relevant, I\\'ll share my opinion.\\n\\nI\\'ve been to the Fogos in Dallas, Beverly Hills, and now Las Vegas. My best experience was in Dallas, but understanding that I was there right after their opening, and because Fogo corporate is in Dallas, I think they worked at \"doing it all\". This was probably before they reviewed and revised their operations. (?) Dallas was the best. Beverly Hills, and now Las Vegas, were both a disappointment, but more because they do not reflect the best of what I expect in a \"high end\" churrascaria. And I personally think they\\'re making a mistake. Here\\'s what most non-Brasilians are missing....... but wouldn\\'t know it if they\\'ve never been to a more \"typical\" churrascaria in Brasil.\\n\\nThe salad bar.... In Brasil, and at churrascarias like Fogo in Sao Paulo, Rio, and the interior cities like Brasilia, Goiania and Uberlandia, there will be everything you see at Fogo in LV, plus another full bar of hot entrees, including fish and meat dishes, stroganoff, hot vegetables, rice and black beans. And yes, the fried plantans too. All this is available at the bar, all you can eat, not brought to your table like at Fogo. You\\'ll also see that \"cheese bread\" called \"pao de queiju.\" In some restaurants, there\\'ll be either a small, or very expanded sushi bar. The salad bar, by itself, can easily support anyone\\'s craving for a full meal. Fogo\\'s salad bar is amazingly small, in my opinion, and for Brasililans, incomplete... especially for the money! Fogo offers the \"salad bar only\" for under $30... but in my opinion, it\\'s not worth it. If they had a traditionally full salad bar offering, it would be great for non-red meat eaters, as there would be a huge variety of fish, shrimp, etc. \\n\\nThe meats... Here, Fogo does well, as the quality of the meats is very good. While some churrascarias buy low end meats, my feeling is that what Fogo doesn\\'t offer in the salad bar, they make up for in the meat department.\\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT GETTING WHAT YOU WANT... If you want rare, medium rare, well done, etc., you should tell both the table waiter, and the meat servers! I will sometimes tell the servers that I only want the Picanha (tri-tip), the Filet, and the Fraudinha (flank steak). You\\'re paying... tell them what you want, and how you like it! They appreciate your specifics, and even at this Fogo, I got what I wanted in meats.\\n\\nThe service... For a high-end churrascaria, it was ill-timed meat delivery, and it was slow. And when the gauchos (meat servers) did start coming to the table, it was an \"onslaught.\" The mark of a great churrascaria is \"consistency\" with an even rhythm. We spoke to our waiter, assigned to manage our table, and I could see that he was struggling to maintain service level to us, and other tables. That issue alone... erradic service, would be a major complaint point. And for this Fogo, all I could think of was....... this would never fly in Sao Paulo, or Rio, or at any other of their Brasilian locations. \\n\\nA major deal breaker for Brasilians, and what told me this operation was tailored to \"Non-Brasilians\", was the fact that they serve rice and black beans only after being asked. Had I not asked, our table may have been overlooked. That\\'s rediculous, as the foundation for a plate in Brasil is your rice, black beans, vinegrette salsa, and farofa, or toasted corn meal that tops off the beans rice and salsa. When you have to ask for those very basic items, you know that Fogo has tailored, or \"dumbed down\" their restaurant to non Brasilians. And frankly, most people love these items after being introduced, and shown how to \"build their plate.\"\\n\\nSo I gave Fogo a 4-star just because they do serve great quality meat. And knowing ignorance is bliss, I figure that if what they do serve is good, and the clientel like it. who am I to complain because they don\\'t mimic my preferred style of service. (although....... I do think you deserve better than what they offer at their salad bar setup.)\\n\\nBTW..... for a more traditional salad bar, and certainly more complete, visit Texas de Brazil at the Town Square Shopping Center, off South Las Vegas Blvd. I think you\\'ll better understand my comments about the salad bar, and maybe agree that the trade-off at Texas de Brazil may be in the quality of the meat.',\n",

He had been some years back before, and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know, is that considered a mountain, or is it a hill? Being from the south everything that makes me lift my legs/feet higher is a mountain). It was rather empty as it was only like 11.30AM, but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke ... maybe).

During the course of the meal, he did inform us that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day, what're gonna do? It didn't bother me too much, but I think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol. He told some good albeit corny jokes, did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertaining.\\n\\nThe food: oh man, was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't describe, but they were the best soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super delicious. The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce, but it didn't taste like it at all to me, which was fine with me because I'm not a big teriyaki fan. \\n\\nAfter eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece.

       " 723: 'Ordered from Say Cheese for the first time this past weekend. We got two salads (the Mandarin and the Steak) and some cheese sticks. The cheese sticks tasted like the frozen variety so not horrible, but it was sort of like, \"Really?\" My boyfriend didn\\'t like the chicken in his Mandarin salad, said he would\\'ve preferred it grilled, but he liked the dressing and the rest of the toppings. My steak salad was fab. I\\'d get it again.\\n\\nI think the food is mediocre to good, but what gets them 4 stars is the service. We got our food delivered and it was there in a totally reasonable time. You know how with delivery guys/gals it seems to either be stoner college kids or some rude asshat? Total opposite with Say Cheese. The delivery guy was very nice, polite, and friendly. I mean, really - this shouldn\\'t even be a thing I complain about, but I\\'ve had so many bad experiences with delivery people that I dread going to the door to meet them. So props to you Say Cheese.',\n",
       " 724: \"We visited this restaurant before heading on to see Snow White & the Huntsman at South Side Works. We wanted some place cheap and different from our usual steak/burgers/etc. fare.\\n\\nThai Me Up (what a stupid name) is small and there isn't much in the way of decor, but none of that really matters as it is also cheap eats. Altogether we had the lemon grass soup, a spring roll, pad thai and green curry with chicken and tofu and a side of steamed white rice.\\n\\nMy rice was soggy on the bottom, which is disturbing when I'm eating out. I can't cook rice to save my life, but, considering it should be rather simple and easy to prepare, it's a little scary when a restaurant can't get it right. The green curry was delicious, but my absolute favorite was the spring roll. This is surprising for me as I hate spring rolls, but the dipping sauce was amazingly good!\\n\\nThe lemongrass soup was also quite tasty and very different from any other soup I've had before. My boyfriend's pad thai was pretty good, though we've both had better elsewhere (can't really complain for the price, though).\\n\\nI'm only giving Thai Me Up 3 stars because, although the food was tasty, it left you wanting something more flavor-wise. Some of the items were threatening to veer into the bland side of the specturm. Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park was much more appealing, but the location leaves a lot to be desired. I recommend it for better thai food, but if you're looking to hang out in the south side and people watch or go out later, Thai Me Up is the perfect place for some quick, cheap eats.\",\n",
       " 725: \"If we could give half stars, I would say this place is about a 3.5. I've only really visited during Jazz Fest and one time for Jazz Live on Tuesday nights. I had fun! I love the moscato wine they have, it's really delicious. And they have started carrying a menu supported by Meat & Potatoes so you can't lose, ya know? We tried the nachos and the hanger steak - omg, were they good, especially those nachos. I know, it's nachos, but you can tell they use fresh ingredients AND they make their own cheese sauce. Yummy.\\n\\nOur last server there (who was actually the bartender, but someone left him stranded) was very attentive and friendly. He remembered us from our first visit, which was nice. I think Backstage Bar is a good change of pace from the rest of the scene downtown - very chill, low-key, laid-back, etc. etc. I say give it a try, especially if you're looking for a more ... mature, maybe? ... classy atmosphere.\",\n",
       " 726: \"Yay, finally - rooftop (sort of) seating and good food!\\n\\nI have been to Round Corner twice now and I love it. The first thing that won me over was the authenticity of their tacos. No lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, ground beef, or other Americanized fillings here. Radishes, housemade salsas, cilantro, and all of the other ingredients you'd actually find in authentic Mexican-style tacos. And boy, are they good!\\n\\nI have tried the tacos de carne (hanger steak) and the tacos de puerco (pork belly). They were both great, but the puerco was definitely the better of the two. The apple salsa and the poblano made it just spot-on delicious! I've also tried the chips with salsa and their guacamole. I would recommend the guac over the salsa. The salsa wasn't bad, but it was sort of average. The guac was nice and creamy with bits of cilantro (I love cilantro).\\n\\nOn to the alcohol: the selection is small and Mexican, which is fine with me because I love my Tecate and Dos Equis Amber (small and Mexican - NO PUN INTENDED hehe). \\n\\nOne of the things I love about this place is the price is right. Two tacos, a 24-ounce Tecate, and chips & guacamole would run you about $18 - not bad at all.\",\n",
       " 727: \"I LOVE this place. First time I dropped by was when I had a craving for some bison burgers, but didn't want to shell out the cash to go to Burgatory. The bison was incredibly flavor and juicy, though all we did was salt and pepper it (they were cooked after a Steelers game and we were in no capacity to do anything more than salt and pepper). \\n\\nI have bought their bison a few times along with a couple of NY strips, ground lamb, and ground venison. The NY strips didn't seem to be any better than you can get at Giant Eagle on a good day, but the lamb was just as amazing as the ground bison. We made burgers out of the venison (we're burger and steak people, yes), which were pretty delicious, though of all meats for a burger, bison holds my heart.\\n\\nI've never had issues with the staff. Sure, they aren't super perky like the attendants at GE, but that doesn't really bother me. I've almost always managed to get in and out pretty quickly. The customers are indeed another story lol. On weekends it's a big mix of everyone, of course, since that is when the Strip is busiest. During the weekdays - hehe, it's an adventure.\\n\\nAnyhoo, their prices are comparable to other butchers I have visited around town and their selection of meats is incredible. Check the exotic meats. My boyfriend and I are planning on trying out a couple of those sometime in the near future. :D\",\n",
       " 728: \"This is hands down my favorite upscale restaurant in Pittsburgh. My boyfriend and I are regulars during their Sunday brunch and they have never disappointed. I can't comment on the service provided by the waiters and waitresses as we always sit at the bar, but the few I have chatted during a slow lunch hour with were super nice. One of the managers recognizes us because we're in there so much and he is always incredibly nice and attentive as well. The bartenders have to be my favorite people in there, though. ;) Funny, lively, and mix up some really great drinks as well. I have yet to be disappointed there.\\n\\nOn to the food: I will admit that the first time we visited shortly after they opened I ordered a roasted chicken dish that is no longer on the menu and for good reason - it was terrible. I've had much better at other restaurants of lower scale and at home! My boyfriend wasn't much impressed with his meal, either (I forget what he ordered), and we were pretty sure we'd never come back ... until one of our friends dragged us back in. Thank God he did. I have not been disappointed since.\\n\\nThe wagyu entree is my favorite of all the ones listed. It's so mouth-wateringly yummy. Their mussels are pretty spot on as well. I've heard people rave about the bone marrow, though I have not tried it yet (our friend ALWAYS orders that when he's in town). Their tuna tartare is also quite delicious and I love that they pair it with a seaweed salad - so good.\\n\\nTheir cocktail and beer of the day drinks are always pretty good, at least the ones I've tried thus far. I love the atmosphere of the place and the decor. The only thing missing for me is some patio seating. Yes, I know they have that outdoor area, but that doesn't cut it for me lol. Having moved here from Florida, though, I am resigned to the fact that I may have left the days of patio/balcony seating pretty much behind, except for a few places here and there (which usually aren't very good :/). All in all, 5/5 for Meat & Potatoes for me!\",\n",
       " 729: \"I have to update this review. Even though I can't give it more than 5 stars, I just have to. I love this place that. much.\\n\\nI have to call out two of my favorite bartenders ever (of any place I've lived!), Blake and Mikey. The amount of awesome that they are is hard to describe. So I shan't. Just make sure you visit M&P some time on a weekday as they generally don't work weekends anymore and request a cocktail like the tequila old fashioned or the Honey Boo Boo.\\n\\nAlso, the kobe beef corn dog. Omg, that corn dog. Best. Corn dog. Ever. \\n\\nThe only reason I would consider not moving out of Pittsburgh (besides my boyfriend, of course ... ) is Meat & Potatoes. Now I'm sounding like the obsessive girlfriend, but damn y'all, the food is bombtastic.\",\n",
       " 730: \"Oh man, I wanted to like this place so hard for multiple reasons: Mexican food is one of my top three favorite types of cuisine, they have rooftop seating (score!), it's affordable eats in Shadyside - ohmuhgawd!\\n\\nWe visited during the Shadyside Arts Festival, which was a bad move on our part. Everything in Shadyside was crazy packed. However, we weren't in a rush to get anywhere so that didn't bother us too much. We put our names on a the list for a table and the wait was only about 15-20 minutes. Unfortunately, they seated us at a table that had a speaker situated about 2 feet above it. As loud as they were playing their music, this was not cool. I saw a couple leaving the bar so we snagged their seats instead.\\n\\nThe bar area is neat and reminds me of one of my favorite bars back in Florida (Monkey Bar in Orlando!). The open air design is very nice. The bar was packed, which was not surprising as it definitely has the best seats in the house, besides the rooftop.\\n\\nI've read and heard of others complaining about the service and it was no different when we visited. My boyfriend had actually come earlier in the week and said there was barely anyone there and the service still was incredibly slow. So there's that.\\n\\nI decided to start off with a mojito, one of my favorite drinks. This place goes down as making probably the second worst mojito I've ever had. There was so much club soda! It's just supposed to be a splash! *sigh*\\n\\nWe put in orders for carne asada tacos, Pescado tacos, and the roja salsa and chips. The salsa was just straight up awful. I don't know what they do to it, but I have never had salsa that bad. I asked one of the bartenders to take it off for us because neither one of us would be eating it.\\n\\nI was delighted to see that they make most of their food authentically: cilantro, queso fresca, salsa, etc. Sadly, the steak in my tacos was way overdone. It was crunchy. They should also greatly consider double wrapping their shells. While tasty, those things do not hold up at all. It's no fun eating a taco with a fork. My boyfriend said his mahi mahi tacos were super delish and they looked it. Whatever they do to the black beans is to die for and the spanish rice was really good. However, I don't think they'll be knocking off Round Corner Cantina for good, authentic Mexican food for me (and it's cheaper!). \\n\\nPros: great bar area, would be fantastic for hanging out and having drinks\\n\\nCons: slow service, so-so food\",\n",
       " 731: 'Very disappointing. We love Japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in Pittsburgh. Nice atmosphere, service was fine, but our dinner was average to poor. The salad dressing was tasteless, the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy.  It tasted more steamed than hot grilled. The shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful.\\nOur chef ( new and slow) compulsively wiped his knives and the grill (which was dirty when we sat down) with a dirty rag? \\nI guess a lot depends on the chef you get but ours cooked a tasteless meal. The sushi people ordered at the table looked good. \\n\\nWe are not big on the circus atmosphere of Saga, but the Wexford location does have the best hibachi food in Pittsburgh to our taste.',\n",

If you're looking for shrimp flying and loud chefs singing obnoxious songs then this is not for you. If you want a friendly  atmosphere and delicious food then this is your place. \\nThe sushi is fresh and tasty. The quality of food is obviously there.\",\n",
       " 736: \"This place has the weirdest entrance ever. Just be prepared. \\n\\nCame for my sons 5th birthday last night. He's a little foodie. The restaurant itself is nice and we were seated pretty quickly.  Our waitress showed up 2 seconds later to take drink orders and appetizer/sushi orders. I just asked for water and some time to actually look at the menu. several min later out waitress came back with drinks and asked to take orders. I ordered chicken and steak along with a cranberry mojito. Quickly after taking orders our waitress brought out our soup. I liked it but it lacked salt. Before I even finished the salad course came out. I was able to enjoy both before the chef came out to prepare our meal. What did bother me was all the dishes in our area. I can't stand a dirty table and I wish our waitress would have removed them sooner. Our chef Penny wasn't the best hibachi chef I've seen but she was great with my son and he really enjoyed watching her. She was honestly a lot of fun. The hibachi itself was pretty good. I liked the fried rice which is an up charge. The steak was good and so was the chicken. I honestly don't think it was anything special. Dessert was ice cream also nothing special. \\n\\nSo to sum it up our waitress seemed overwhelmed and managed to make me feel rushed even though I feel she could have visited our table a few more times then she did. That along with being overpriced is why only the 3 stars.\",\n",
       " 737: \"I wish I could write 2 reviews for this place one for Sunday brunch and one for for dinner last night. So I did my best to average out the stars and I landed at 3. \\n\\nFor starters this place is beautiful. From the amazing painting on one wall, to the ceiling and the white cloth tables this place screams classy. Both times we've been here the decore has not disappointed. The breakfast here was great. Maybe the best hotel breakfast I've been to. The food is fresh and other then waiting at the omelet station for about 5 min before flagging someone down to get someone to make me an omelet I really can't complain. Now onto last night dinner. \\n\\nWalking in there was barley any tables taken. We had a reservation but it certainly wasn't needed. We were seated at a table with a booth on one side and a chair on the other. It was a cozy little corner. When we opened the menu we noticed it was very different from the one listed on the site. It was a bit disappointing. I know it's only August but pumpkin fritters sounded amazing. Bry ordered a beer and asked for the restaurant week menu. Which wasn't provided with the menu and when we did get it it was a bit worse for wear. Several min later the waiter came back and asked for the restaurant week menu so he could show it to the chef... So apparently it was the only restaurant week menu they had. When the waiter came back we asked if the chef was ok with the restaurant week menu. The waiter said yes and the the head chef had left so the sous chef was I charge. This didn't sound promising. Alas We decided to go with one of each of the option for restaurant week. At this point Bryan was done with his beer and it was a good 30 min and our waiter had passed our table several times and didn't even notice. Also we were brought bread in that 30 min. The bread was good but was cold and would have been much better warm. There was also no explanation of what it was. I think one was a rustic olive bread and then the other was a bread stick with asiago cheese? Maybe? And the butter had herbs in it but I couldn't tell you what they were. It just tasted like butter to me. When the first course came out the waiter noticed the empty beer glass and asked what he could get us. Bry ordered another beer and we ordered a bottle of wine. The wine was really the best part of the meal. Ok so onto the food. The Brie tart was fantastic. The flavors were bright and I wish I could have had like 2 more. The lobster ravioli was ok. The bacon on it was more chewy then crispy and the ravioli itself was undercooked just a little. The main dishes were steak and pasta. The steak was to salty and the sweet corn custard it was on was the best part. The agnolotti looked really pretty when it came out but it was so undercooked it was sad. I sent it back and the kitchen remade it. I didn't even bother with a pic because I was still very hungry I just dug in. The lemon was to strong and the artichoke was undercooked. It was just a very sad dish but the potential for a good dish is there. I was disappointed. Several min later a manager came over and apologized about the food. We asked about the chef situation and apparently the head chef left to another property and is now In charge of several Omni restaurants. He was genuinely wanting to make our experience better and said he would take all the food off the bill. Dessert was good. The poor guy at the table next to us had the same thing and it blew up a bit and got all over his shirt. So we were warned. The pavlova was good and I enjoyed the berries with just a hint of lemon. It was good and the creamy white chocolate off set it nicely. \\n\\nWe definitely didn't get the amazing food and romantic dinner we were hoping for. Did I mention the street light glaring in my eyes for most of dinner. Hopefully the get a head chef soon. I appreciate the effort from management to try and rectify the situation. He also was at several other tables that night. I'm guessing doing the same thing. This place could really be a great restaurant.  The potential is there but a great head chef is needed. Hopefully there able to work it out. Well prob give it another try since we left the gift card we were going to use at home. Hopefully the kitchen issues are worked out by then.\",\n",
       " 738: \"I've said it before and I'll say it again I don't send food back its not something I like to do. I hate to complain so I don't but man if I was the type I would have. My steak was horrible. It looked like it was left on one side to cook then the last 2sec it was turned. It was over cooked and the little pink that there was was all on the bottom of the steak. Not the middle the bottom. I could have cooked a better steak. Bryan's filet was very fatty. It was just bad. Will not be returning here.\",\n",
       " 739: \"Sometimes ordering to go is just easier then actually sitting down at a restaurant for a meal. That being said I've had take home from here 3x now and have physically gone in 2x including the time from my first review. Each time I've had food from here there's been something wrong. Weather it be no steak in my steak queso which happened again last night!! Or weather it be a steak undercooked or cinnamon sugar missing from a sweet potato that comes with cinnamon sugar.  \\n\\nAll that side over all the food is very good. It's by no means poor quality and the portions are reasonable for a steak house. I chalk the missing steak up to it falling to the bottom of whatever container they take it from and the person who puts it into the dish just takes from the top. \\n\\nNow for the staff our waitress this vast time we went in could have listened a bit better. The other half asked for a beer and she just walked away. Also when we were ordering my sons kids meal we ordered applesauce and told her 3x as she just listed off possible sides.  We also spoke to a very friendly manager who went out of her way to correct the issues we've had over the last several meals. She was genuinely interested in what they should have done better to make the dining experience more enjoyable. F it wasn't for her this would still be a 2 star review.\",\n",
       " 740: \"Let's take a minute to discuss wine etiquette. For instance once a wine glass is places on the table before you it should not be touched again by your waiter until it is removed. Also when you order a bottle of wine your server should always be the one to pore your glass. I have to say all of these rules were met perfectly tonight. \\n\\nI showed up to Andrews hungry and ready for a good meal. They currently have a Valentine's menu and although I'm not a huge seafood fan I still ventured out of my comfort zone and tried their tasting menu. \\n\\nThe starting course was oysters. Yes to my friends who know my tastes I ate oysters tonight. They consisted of oysters on a half shell with horseradish, lavender and caviar. Not something I would try again.    \\n\\nThe second course was an endive salad. It was interesting. I felt there was to much vinegar and the cheese was on the bottom of the plate so I was half way threw before I tasted it. The grape on the dish were carbonized which made for a neat pop of flavor. \\n\\nThe main course was steak and I really enjoyed it. My steak was a bit under cooked. I asked for medium and got rare/medium rare. The flavors were great though. I loved the parsnips and the sauce that accompanied the steak itself was heavenly. \\n\\nDessert was fun. I honestly cant tell you everything that was on the plate but if you see the pic the round white ball was orange flavored and I need a thousand of them.  \\n\\nThis was a good meal. While not great I wouldn't mind coming back and the view of the river was nice as well. Service was perfect and with their extensive wine list I'm sure they have something to fit every pallet.\",\n",

She showed us to a hibachi table took our drink orders and even answered our questions while we waited on our server who she informed us had just walked in a bit late due to the weather. No biggie because she was great and more then accommodating. \\n\\nI started out with sake because what celebration doesn't start out with a good drink. After reviewing the menu I decided on tuna. Included in the meal was soup of your choice and a house salad. I loved the dressing. Our hibachi chef was fun. Not the best I've seen but still put on a good show. My tuna was overcooked but still tasted descent. The fried rice was a bit bland and could have used a bit more seasoning. I also ordered plum wine which is a favorite for me. Over all it was a descent dinner and the 2 other people at the table made for great conversation. I would like to come back and order off the main menu. I feel this place has untapped potential.\",\n",
       " 742: \"Had dinner at this place last night for Bryan's b-day and it was so good. To start with we brought the little man who I think was more excited about daddy's birthday then daddy was. When we arrived we were seated next to there wine cellar that is glassed in which created for the funniest moment of the night but ill get to that in a min. We started with the buffet which was very fresh but didn't have the largest selection which is ok with me because I would rather fill up on meat but I have to say I love beets with goat cheese and they had both so I was in heaven even before the steak. The meat for the most part was great. They prepaid it medium rare but will cook it however you like. As well if you find it to salty which I did not you can ask for it with no salt. The filet just melted in my mouth. This night they had top rib meat which I can't think of the technical name for but it was very fatty and after getting it on my plate I decided I would pass. I also have to compliment the meat guys they were all so good with my son as well as the rest of the wait staff. So many times while being out I've felt like restaurant staff have just dismissed him but I can't think of a single time when my son said something to a waiter or server that they didn't stop and acknowledge him. Now I will leave you with this. If siting by the glass wine seller keep your kids close because mine decided he wanted to check it out and ran right into the glass. Bryan and I laughed so hard. He didn't get hurt or anything and I don't think the table next to us even saw it but it was hilarious. This place is great for the whole family and the meat is amazing!!!!\",\n",

Fist we wait 45 mins or so to be seated. The restaurant wasn\\'t even half full. We chose the dinner portion instead of the lunch because by this time we were very hungry and the waitress said we would get larger portions. She lied. Our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible! He spoke so softly that you couldn\\'t hear anything he said. He barely spoke and didn\\'t put on any kind of show at all! Our 4 year old was so bored that she wanted to leave. The other party that was seated with us all ordered the lunch versions and they got more food! The chef mixed everything together so no one got a larger portion than anyone else. The only thing that we got instead of them was a half a slice of zuccini and a little bit of onions. None of us even like onions. My \"steak\" was at least 1/4 fat which the chef cut off and disposed of which didn\\'t even leave enough for a small sandwich. By the time our main course was served our vegetables and rice were ice cold. We asked to speak to the manager who told us that they weigh the portions in the back before they bring them out to cook them. However like I said the chicken was all mixed together and at least 1/4 of my steak was complete fat and thrown out. The manager didn\\'t seem to care at all about our situation. We paid almost $10 a meal extra for the \"dinner\" portion. He could have easily knocked it down to the \"lunch\" price, but he refused. After all this, we over heard another chef complaining that the place had new owners and everyone quit.  I for one will never, EVER, go back there and would suggest everyone who reads this to stay away. We feel completely cheated.',\n",

Imagine my disappointment when twice I order my \"go to\" chicken and shrimp only to find shrimp is now colossal shrimp that had the consistency of shoe leather and mushrooms apparently don\\'t apply.

One part of my brother\\'s disability is that he only eats the same foods every day and cannot deviate. \\n\\nI asked if we could substitute chicken for shrimp for the appetizer (assuming there would probably be a small up-charge). We also asked that instead of rice or noodles, if, with his steak dinner, he could just have extra vegetables (again, assuming that there may be a small up-charge). Our waitress was very understanding, but said that she had to check with the manager first. She came back and said the manager said they couldn\\'t accommodate.\\n\\nI asked to see manager. Directly in front of my brother, the manager said that they weren\\'t able to accommodate and crassly explained that if \"he\" \"wanted\" a chicken appetizer instead of shrimp, we would have to buy a whole chicken dinner and if \"he\" \"wanted\" extra vegetables instead of rice or noodles, we would just have to buy another dinner.

My brother was uncomfortable and embarrassed and just kept staring down.\\n\\nThis was not the experience I was hoping my brother to have ... a gross display of disgusting and careless discrimination that has made me hurt for him his entire life. He shouldn\\'t have been put in that position.\\n\\nIn case there was any confusion, I calmly made one last ditch effort to privately explain to the manager about my brother, but it was to no avail. I was livid. We paid for our one round of drinks, tipped the waitress - whose compassion touched my heart - and left.\\n\\nI have to admit, I contemplated escalating this. \\n\\nShame on you Benihana. If that manager still has his job, I would suggest some kind of training on how to be a decent human being and not make others feel like they are a second class citizen just because they may be a little different from you.

The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts.  The California grilled salad.  The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos.  Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent.  Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas).  Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.\\n\\nAdditionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu.  They have tons of vegetarian options.  They have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals.  They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.\\n\\nSo basically: the less you know about Mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.

They also ran out of their soup of the day, beef tortellini, so I went with the Texas Chicken Chili.  The meal was only $6.25 plus tax.  Not a bad deal for a home style lunch.  \\n\\nThe sandwich was pretty tasty, just a little too much bread to steak ratio, but flavors were savory .  The soup strangely appeared to have no chicken.  In fact I proposed the opinion of my co-worker to identify the meat.  Indeed we agreed beef.  Good thing I like beef,  but not sure why they would call it chicken chili.

This was the only day available that I could get a reservation at a normal dinner hour time.  I have tried in the past to make reservations here and because I am not into eating dinner at 11:45 pm, I have been unsuccessful.  But here we were, and I was so excited to finally try B&R especially during Restaurant week.\\n\\nFor starters we were seated pretty promptly upstairs in a long communal type of table.  Though the tables themselves were separated (as they had to be in order to get in and out) you could easily reach to your left or right and hold the stranger sitting next to you.  It also induced an awkward situation that the waiter had  to talk to the back of my husband\\'s head all night unless he wanted to do a 180 to speak at him directly.  The place was also very dark, which led to an unfortunate incident I shall unveil at the proper time.  Not initimatly dark, but more like bedtime dark with flickering candles.  \\n\\nSo to the food, again extremely excited, and again looked online at their Restaurant week menu and was eager to try the menu, but alas without making it known on Restaurant week\\'s website, the chef decided to change the menu daily.  I can\\'t remember what was on the website but I recall being disappointed because I really wanted to try it.  Due to the new findings the hubs ordered off the regular menu.  He went with the WAGYU FLANK STEAK prepared medium.  I stuck to the altered restaurant week menu that had four courses.  1)corn fritters with an aoli 2) a pea soup with half a toasted cheese sammie 3) A seafood pasta dish 4) A flaky cream pastry with lemon, berries and a chocolate sauce.  I also ordered a couple overpriced Manhattans.\\n\\nThe food came at a good pace.  The corn fritters were rather good but were sitting in a vessel on top of the sauce making it difficult to dip them individually (had to ask for some extra on the side).  Next the pea soup and cheese sandwich.  This was definitely the best thing I had that evening.  The pea soup was delightful.  The gourmet grilled cheese great flavor and worked well together with the creamy pea soup.  I will say from here my dining experience started to plummet.  Next my seafood pasta came out along with the wagyu for my husband.  So remember how it was really dark in there?  The dish was prepared with a darker noodle and my first bit was full of shrimp and prawn shells.  They left all the shells on in this dark place hidden in this dark dish.  I spent the rest of the time picking shells out of my teeth and feeling the pain of regret.  At one point I pulled a huge prawn whisker from my mouth and said that\\'s it I can\\'t eat this anymore.  Funny thing, my very close neighbor, who I could hear easily, flagged down the waiter and began to tell him how much she disliked her meal and I quote \"this tastes like a fishes ass.\"  Sadly I looked down and we were eating the same thing.  To add to the disappointment my husband\\'s wagyu was tough.  I mean a $30.00 steak should melt in your mouth and it was so tough and chewy, just not a choice cut whatsoever.  \\n\\nThe desert was average to me, I am not a big sweets fan.  I split this with my husband who adamantly believes fruit doesn\\'t belong in deserts unless it\\'s apple pie. But nevertheless helped me eat it.

However, as I ate there last night, I saw the lower end of the spectrum. I had a shrimp/scallops pasta dish (Diablo Pasta?), and it was not spicy at all (despite being advertised as such). It was just OK (the ingredients, other than the sauce, were pretty good, but the sauce was just passable). A friend of mine said that the French Onion soup was awful (way too much oregano, he said), and his \"sirloin\" sandwich was not sirloin.

Fortunately, the dish was succulent and despite my better judgement I finished all of the huge platter of 2 poached eggs and corned beef, although I did leave much of the hollandaise sauce as it was too much.  The wait staff were attentive and I was able to try a number of microbrew Stouts with the Irish eggs benedict (these went together quite well) as my glass never was quite finished before they asked if I wanted another.  There is also an incredible scotch cabinet as you walk in the door.  This is one of the best collections of scotch that I have seen outside of NYC.',\n",

There was an altercation at the bar area, which almost ended up in a fight.  It disrupted the whole restaurant and after the culprit was removed from the restaurant, it took someone in my party twice to ask the manager to call the police (the culprit was just standing outside the restaurant) because maybe the manager thought he was kidding the first time?

There's an extensive drinks menu, so you'll definitely be able to find something that works for you.\\n\\nTo start, our table got the fried chicken livers, the lobster mac and cheese, and the pierogies.  It was my first time trying chicken livers and they were delicious, as was the mac and cheese (which had a doritos crust that was really surprisingly good).  The pierogies tasted fine, but were cold so we asked the waiter to heat them up and they came back cold again, which was the main negative of the meal and the reason why I didn't give a full 4 stars.\\n\\nFor the entr\\xc3\\xa9e, I split the ribeye for two with a party member.  It was exactly like how I envisioned it.  Cooked exactly like how we wanted and the flavor was unbelievable.  It came with potato wedges and bone marrow, which were delicious as well.\\n\\nJust a heads up, though (which I didn't know until we ordered), that the ribeye for two takes up to an hour to cook.

However, one is more than enough for 2.\\n\\nEntrees then came to the table and I had the Roasted Turkey Cobb salad which was also done well and the turkey was a nice change to the Cobb salads usual chicken.

Other than the regular fries everything else was thoroughly enjoyed.\\n\\nFinally, after many drinks we decided would could all split a desert. My father was the only smart one who decided he didn't want to share, but ended up with the saddest looking desert I have ever seen. He ordered a vanilla bean cake dish that he said was good, but the presentation was very underwhelming. The rest of us ordered the baked appletini desert with vanilla ice cream.

See what happens when I try to eat healthy?  The meat was cooked medium, it had a pretty solid pink center, yet it was dry as a bone, it didn't make sense to me.

I ordered a hot sausage and cheese for myself, a black angus top sirlion and cheese for the wife and split a order of 6 chicken fingers for the kids (it comes with fries, what a deal!). After I placed my order I waited by the bar and unfortunately it was when the death of Steve Mcnair started to air :-(. The bar quickly filled up after I placed my order. The sandwiches took a little while to prepare and not as quick as I\\'ve heard they are. I got my order and in my usual fashion I checked it. No chicken finger and fries....bummer. I go back to the cashier/bartender/cook and asked her for my order who asks the cook where it is and he shrugs like \"I dunno\" so , she grabs some new chicken fingers and tosses them into the fryer so now I have to wait even longer for my food. I was planning to take it to go and eat at my hotel because there was no free parking out front. My hotel is by the airport so I wanted the sandwiches to be fresh as possible so that I can get the full experience. The chicken fingers took even longer to prepare so I am waiting and hoping my food doesn\\'t get cold. Finally, after awhile watching the news my order is ready and I dash out and drive back to my hotel. First let me say the kids INHALED the chicken fingers like I never seen them do before and they have tried chicken fingers everywhere. The fries they didn\\'t care for so much. I ate half my sandwich which was no longer hot and it wasn\\'t bad, my wife didn\\'t really care for hers since the amount of steak was skimpy. We would definitely try Primanti\\'s again just not the ones we got this time and we will eat them at the location so that they are fresh as another complaint my wife had was the ingredients didn\\'t seem fresh. I can cross Primanti\\'s off my list of things to do in the da \\'burgh. Now if I can only get over my fear of heights and ride those inclines.',\n",

Arrived at the location and it looked to be closed, it was just around 4pm and yelp listed hours as opening at 2pm. So I call and someone answers and says they open at 4pm...we look and still seems closed and the door has a chain on the gate. But a few seconds later someone comes out and unchained the gate. We walk in and see a sign to go to the bar to be seated. We get to the bar and the barkeep seats us promptly and says a waitstaff will be right with us. The decor was ok, it was very dark inside and I felt like I was taken back to the 60's-70's. Kind of like a mob movie and I was wondering when I would be bumped off lol. Our waitress came and gave us menus and asked what drinks we would like. Drinks took a bit but that was probably because they just opened as we had the whole place to ourselves aside from the two patrons at the bar. We got our drinks and ordered our food, waitress was polite and answered my dates questions. Food came out in good time and it was great, I had the BBQ chicken and she had the prime rib...I enjoyed my food, and she enjoyed her steak. Despite the low lighting me and my date had a great time during our visit. I would come back.\",\n",

Like gnats, we were attracted to Primati because their neon sign was... pretty.... soooooo pretty!\\n\\nAnyway, stopped in here and order the Pittsburgh cheesesteak which was quite tasty. We also got the Cajun chicken sandwich with cheese... because everything there comes with cheese. Everything. Need salt? Even that has cheese on it. It's kinda awesome.\\n\\nAnyway, both sandwiches were quite tasty and with the fries on top... yummy.  Would definitely come back here next time I'm coming through Pittsburgh, hopefully for longer than a few hours.\",\n",
       " 808: \"We ate at Primanti Bros based on the reviews on Yelp, hoping to get a real taste of Pittsburgh. What I ordered was a sandwich labeled Pittsburgher Cheese Steak. What I got was an inedible slab of overcooked mystery meat, cole slaw, and mediocre fries, on white bread. The sandwich was very small, but I only ate 1/2 of it anyway, and I have a pretty big appetite. I recently ate a 20 oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint.\\n\\nI was truly shocked. That was the worst meat that I have seen since Junior High School. We would have been much better off at Burger King. Luckily we had a nice lunch at Salim's to wash the taste of this junk of our mouths.\",\n",

I asked the waitress what was the most requested item and she said, \"You\\'re drinking it honey.\" pointing to my Iron City pint.  Which was $2.95 by the way.  God bless the Burgh.  \\n\\nSo the sandwich is as I remember.  Huge, but if you squeeze you can get your mouth around it.  I realized my second time around that there\\'s a reason they can keep prices low.  There\\'s not a whole lot of meat in the sandwich.  It\\'s dwarfed by the coleslaw and the fries.  I\\'d also pass on the cheesesteak next time.  It was a square beef patty which didn\\'t seem right and there wasn\\'t a lot of flavor.  Would get pastrami next time for sure.  \\n\\nSo the sandwich and decor of this location would rate 3 stars, but the concept of a restaurant that serves you an oversized sandwich with coleslaw and fries on it for  around 5 bucks rates 5, so it equals out to 4.  This sandwich and chain are one of the reasons I love the Burgh so much.',\n",

I also got a 23oz yuengling for $3. To be completely honest, the food is not especially great, but its the novelty and uniqueness that makes me give it such a high rating.

There is a rectangular patty, provelone cheese, fries topped by slaw between two slices of italian bread.  The bread was great, but the rest of the sandwich was short on flavor.

Excellent but EXPENSIVE place, we had a $100 dining credit so it wasn\\'t quite a big of a hit but otherwise this place will eat up some serious cash. Service was very friendly but they were a bit too pushy IMO in trying to sell dessert, I\\'m sure it was tasty but I was just too full. \\n\\nThe food is top notch as you\\'d expect for this price. They start you off with some of the tastiest bread I\\'ve had at any restaurant. One is lemon herb bread that isn\\'t cornbread but looks a bit like it, one is a cinnamon roll type bread, and one is a crispy baguette slice, try them all plain and with some of the butter. The French Onion Soup is interesting here, it\\'s thicker than most places and it really rich. It almost has the consistency of gravy rather than soup which I enjoyed but I could see it being too think for some people. We had fingerling potatoes (might\\'ve been the best potatoes I\\'ve ever had) and shitake mushrooms (enjoyable as well with a ginger taste) as sides. As for the main course, I had the 18oz New York Strip. This was a huge steak with not too much fat and cooked perfectly medium well, I wasn\\'t able to finish this but gave it my absolute best shot.\\n\\nThere were a couple of minor odd things here, they show you the drink menu on an iPad which is kinda interesting but they only give you one so you have to pass it around. It\\'s a cool gimmick but I think a regular menu would be easier. Do try a drink though, the Drifter is an expensive but tasty bourbon drink. Be sure and also specify tap water unless you want to pay for your H20, your choice but be warned. One last weird thing that may only matter to me is the steak knife handle was oddly uncomfortable when I was slicing up my massive slab of meat. Never had that happen before it somehow was a little annoying.\\n\\nThis place is expensive so I wouldn\\'t come too often.

(I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. \\n\\nThe ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn\\'t stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients. \\n\\nOn the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich.

Overall, I really like the place, but there are a few refinements that they could take on that would make the place a little better. Overall, the atmosphere and service are pretty good. The atmosphere isn't on the casual side, but not too stuffy either. I have experienced the occasionally inconsistent service experience, though. I loved Emily, at the bar--great attitude and excellent service. \\n\\nThe restaurant offers an extensive wine list, with many by the glass, but their markup seemed little higher that many places. They also have a small selection (about 5) of microbrews on draft (with other selections in the bottle) that are appealing--not extensive in that regard, but enough to keep a craft beer drinker from going thirsty. \\n\\nOverall, I'd say the food is pretty good. Certainly a cut above, but not top of the line. One of the things that the restaurant boasts is that it uses local and sustainable growers and suppliers for its ingredients. A definite plus in my book. In everything that I have had here, the ingredients were definitely fresh and flavorful. \\n\\nI have had a few different items here and they have all been pretty good. My first time in I had the filet mignon, which was very good--mashed potatoes were great with that as well. I have also had the chicken and the salmon here, and all were pretty good. My one complaint about the food would be that they tend to overcook the meats a little--med-rare steak comes out more like medium; well-done does not need to mean cooked dry; that sort of thing. The service staff and management always strove to make it right, though, which is something you don't always find anymore. I have also had the stirfried vegetables on their mixed grill plate several times and they have always come out great--not too firm or too soft with great fresh flavor. \\n\\nDespite its few inconsistancies, overall Sonoma Grille offers a pretty solid dining experience. I definitely recommend a pop-in if you are travelling through Pittsburgh and are looking for a a pretty good bite paired with a great wine.\",\n",

Very flavorful and had a decent amount of capers. The sauce and bread on it was unique but added so much to the flavor. We split a wedge salad and that was good enough to end on. \\n\\nHowever, we soldiered on and had a strip steak and a bone-in filet. The steaks were freakin\\' amazing. The strip was 14-16 oz. and full of flavor. I\\'d never had a bone-in filet before but this was a great steak. Both steaks were prepared perfectly to our specifications and the chef even came out to make sure the meal was going well.

Not much cheese either. \\nMy crew had the kielbasa sandwich and the ham sandwich respectively. They looked great. \\nI don't think fries on my sandwich works for me either.

There were only about 3 people in front of me in the takeout line, so it shouldn\\'t have taken long for me to place an order, right? Wrong. It took maybe 15-20 minutes for those 3 orders to be taken because nobody would commit themselves to working the register. While waiting in line, I got to see all these mouthwatering sandwiches being made. Once I placed my order, it didn\\'t take long to come out...\\n\\nSo I got a Pittsburgh cheese steak, their #2 most popular item (don\\'t ask what their #1 is...the guy will roll his eyes and unenthusiastically say, \"beer.\") Long story short, what I ended up with was a bland, lukewarm beef party with bland soggy fries on top. The cold lettuce and tomato cooled the sandwich even more. I enjoyed the coleslaw on top, which is pretty much all I ended up eating from the sandwich. And a few limp fries. Disappointing.',\n",

The pickles were 5 star deliciousness! I just loved them, and may have pushed my dad out of the way to claim the last as my own. The sandwiches were yummy too! I loved the kielbasa itself, but had to hunt to find the promised cheese. The coleslaw is really excellent - tangy and light, and I personally like it a lot on the sandwich itself. The fries were less excellent. I don't know if they would have been better on the side rather than on the sandwich, but they were kind of cold, soggy, and unsalted. Didn't stop me from eating them, though. I think that if the fries were better, this would be a 4 star establishment.\",\n",

Got the steak sandwich with everything on it.  I ate most of it and wasn't even that hungry to begin with.  Definitely needed salt/pepper and the hot sauce they had.  When you add potatoes to a sandwich it tends to make it taste bland unless you have a killer sauce.  The sandwich could feed most people for two meals and it's only $7..great value.  23 oz miller lite was only $4..also so cheap.

I personally love the Angus black steak but the most popular version is definitely the cheesesteak, which I would guess is Pittsburgh's version of the Philly cheesesteak.  I also like the carved turkey breast version as well, which is a good option for a semi-lighter option.

The  kofte was slightly greasy but very nicely seasoned.  The chicken was good but not outstanding.  But the lamb!  Next time I'm just getting the lamb chops.  They were so amazing.  The parmesan truffle fries were light and crispy and the side portion was huge.  Same for the crispy onion strings.  The cracked wheat pilaf was flavorful without any trace of greasiness, which is a common problem in many varieties.  Entree portions are pretty small but the service was very fast although I did need to remind them to bring my tea twice.  Beer selection is decent.  I selected to have a 3-cheese plate for dessert.

Firstly, the food had no flavor. That has nothing to do with our party size. I ordered the sardine & cheese, but in our party there were grilled chicken sandwiches, black bean burgers, & cheese steaks ordered. The sandwiches were big, especially for the price. But no flavoring, just overcooked, unseasoned meat with too many steak fries (in the sandwich) & weak cheese. The only seasoning available are salt, pepper, hot sauce, & ketchup. BIG disappointment. \\n\\nI'll cut them slack on the service because we were a big party, but they couldn't handle it well.

The cole slaw is a vinegar based slaw. It is is a little different but it had a nice tang to the sandwich. Although the sandwich was huge there really is not a lot of meat. You can ask for additional meat for a small charge. Overall it was a good experience but not quite as mind blowing as Guy described.\",\n",

No worries, we were seated fairly quickly inside. The restaurant itself was styled like mid-1900s diner and was really pretty cool. Service was quick and before I knew it I had a Pittsburgher sandwich - the quintessential Primanti Bros meal. It was a sizable sandwich stacked with Pittsburgh cheesesteak, coleslaw, fries, and tomatoes. The coleslaw was tangy but not creamy (a plus in my book), the fries were crispy, and the meat was tender. The meat and bread both left me wanting more. The Italian bread was thick...and that\\'s about all I can say for it. Wholly generic otherwise. The meat also lacked any distinguishing flavor other than \"meaty.\" I really could have used some more seasoning and flavor from the two biggest components of the sandwich. I\\'m glad we made it out to Primanti Bros, but I\\'m not sure I\\'d rush back, especially since Pittsburgh has so much else to offer.

The menu is fairly short, seemed to be just ribs and chicken.  Not very many southern sides either - no cabbage, squash or fried okra. And they didn't have brewed iced-tea!  It's bad enough that I have to deal with that fact in most Pennsylvania restaurants, but one that claims to be Southern?\\n\\nEnough lamenting about the menu.  Let's just focus on the food they do have.  Fried chicken with two sides - macaroni and cheese and baked beans.  The fried chicken was overcooked and dry.  Better at Popeyes.  The mac and cheese?  You could tell it was homemade, but it had the same mushiness of Stouffers frozen.  Now the baked beans, this was a fusion dish - sweet yankee baked beans with hotness (and it wasn't Louisiana hot sauce, thank God). A very good combination that got my mind wondering - what if you mixed those sweet baked beans with chopped jalapenos, like they do ranch-style beans?  The corn bread was good.  I prefer sweet corn bread, but that's just a personal preference.\\n\\nTwo more notes.  Service is slow.  Very slow.  This isn't good at lunch.  And the restaurant has the same ventilation problems that Steel City Diner had - smoke from the fryer just hangs in the air.\\n\\nNext time I'll try the ribs.  Or maybe breakfast .

       " 951: 'I\\'ve known about Tamari for awhile, and I think this review is long overdue!\\n\\nTamari is located in the 3500 block of Butler street in Lawrenceville and sprang up as an early part of the rebirth and rebuilding of the large Northeast neighborhood of Pittsburgh. It\\'s located among the new restaurants, shops, and boutiques. My understanding is that it\\'s been around for almost 1/2 dozen years, circa Mid-2009. \\n\\nParking is available on both sides of the street, and on side streets, but you\\'ll want to give yourself some extra time before your reservation. There\\'s no valet service, which disappointing because other neighboring restaurants offer it.\\n\\nI\\'m sure the courtyard in the front of the restaurant is popular during nicer weather!  The hostess was very friendly and took our coats. We sat upstairs and I liked how they had a few tables sprinkled in stairwells and in the nooks and crannies of the building. It was a unique space with copper and dark woods.\\n\\nThe menu is immense and offers a great variety of foods to sample. We had a hard time deciding what to eat because we wanted to try everything.\\n\\nWe had the chips and guac which was fairly standard, but the fresh jalape\\xc3\\xb1os were delicious. We also had the pork belly which was fantastic! I\\'ve had pork belly all over the city, but I\\'ve never enjoyed it as much as here. Tamari cuts their pork belly thicker, and so in addition to that super fatty tasty softness, you get some great texture and delicious meatiness as well. It was great!\\n\\nNext, we had their Robata Sampler served with three sauces: chimichurri, teriyaki, and ponzu butter. All the sauces were great but the ponzu butter was the standout. Ponzu means \"vinegar punch\" in Japanese. It was rich and savory and was a great accompaniment to the food-on-a-stick usually cooked slowly over charcoal which is Robatayaki(robata). The two-or-three morsels on each stick were chicken, steak, bacon and quail egg (delicious!), eggplant, salmon, eggplant, salmon, and King Trumpet mushrooms. Everything but the mushrooms were very good. Despite usually enjoying mushrooms, the texture and overall chewiness of the \\'shrooms turned me off.\\n\\nThe specialty tokubetsu maki was some of the best sushi we\\'ve had, although I\\'d admit after a few cocktails and martinis that I can\\'t for the life of me remember what was in it. But it was also delicious, and we eat maki rolls regularly.\\n\\nWe chose the Bulgagi (6oz beef tenderloin with potato croquettes) and the crab cakes. The potato croquettes were great! Crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle, absolutely great meat and potato dish! The meat was tender, great flavor, and even a hint of sweetness. The spicy crab cakes were served with a chili-oil based aioli called rayu.\\n\\nThe Bulgagi was initially undercooked, delivered rare instead of medium, but the problem was quickly rectified without hesitation or delay.\\n\\nWe finished the night with the peanut butter and jelly Cr\\xc3\\xa8me br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e which was fun and tasty. The churros were thick, again with great texture contrasts, and really were a perfect finish for the night.\\n\\nTwo things strike me about Tamari:\\n\\n1. The seasoning on everything was aggressive. The kitchen cooked without fear, and cooked with confidence. There was no lack of flavor in any single bite. Nothing was bland or boring.\\n\\n2. Despite having been around for around six years, Tamari still hasn\\'t lost the passion in food or service. Adrianne(sp?) did a great job. When restaurants start off well, it seems easy enough for them to rest on their laurels.\\n\\nI\\'m very happy to see that Tamari isn\\'t one of them. We\\'ll be back!\\n\\nHighly Recommended.',\n",
       " 952: 'After a weekend of stuffing my face full of turkey, I decided to get some beef today.\\n\\nI opted for Fat Tommy\\'s at Market Square to quench my desire.  Down the Forbes Avenue (almost a side street) approach to Market Square from Stanwix, Fat Tommy\\'s is in a surprisingly newer-looking space.  The layout, tables, and bar area are definitely underwhelming.\\n\\nDuring my brief take-out interaction --- on the phone and pickup/pay, I pay very particular attention to whether I think the waitstaff is happy I\\'m there, or if I\\'m more of a bother. The service was OK --- not particularly friendly, or helpful.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure I like their motto, though, \"Fresh Food with Attitude\" and how that fits in with William Degel\\'s(of Uncle Jack\\'s in NY, or TV)  oft mentioned \"Customer is King.\" mantra.  Is the food supposed to have attitude or the waitstaff?\\n\\nIn any event, I picked the Supreme Cheese Steak. I don\\'t like 9\" hoagies generally, especially with no option for a 12\". I think 9\" can be too small for a big guy like myself and it might be nice to have another 3\" for another $3 bucks, but I digress.\\n\\nIt was a chopped steak and while there was a decent portion of it on there, the mushrooms, green peppers, onions, mayo, and cheese were harder to find. The bread was pretty fresh. The overall sandwich lacked seasoning and lacked that punch that says, \"Damn that\\'s good.\"\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t great but it wasn\\'t terrible either.  I don\\'t see myself craving another one any time soon.\\n\\nTheir credit card machine was down, and so they were copying credit card numbers & expiration dates to run later.

Drinks were great.  My wife and I shared the awesome 34oz Ribeye for two. This ribeye is served with a 1ft bone protruding from the edge of the cutting board style serving platter.  It came with huge steak fries and their bone butter (bone marrow and butter, spices, basically)  We could not have been happier with our meal.  Service was great.  This led to me trying them for lunch.\\n\\nLunch: I had the soft-shell-crab sandwich.  While I knew I was being somewhat adventurous ordering this, I was completely turned off by the texture of the crab. I ate less than half of it and threw it away.  Bad experience.  I chalked this one up to bad menu selection.  (I did notice, however, that this item has been removed from the lunch menu.  I wonder why?!)\\n\\nSecond Dinner:  This time, a different couple joined us for dinner before \"Holiday Pops\" across the street at Heinz Hall.  This time I ordered the Roasted Branzino, which is basically European seabass.  While the presentation was very impressive with basically the whole fish served in a skillet with potatoes, capers, tomatoes, fennel, and artichokes there were problems with the execution.  They remove the bones by slicing the top of the fish and removing what they can through the top.  Long story short -- there were still plenty of bones in my fish.  Next, the fish was relatively small and hardly made a dinner meal for a big guy like myself.  The taste was ok, but playing around with pulling bones out of my mouth (with company) is not an experience I look forward to.\\n\\nAll four of us were underwhelmed with our meals and there are plenty of other alternatives that do a better job.\\n\\nMy overall impression is that service is generally good, and the cocktails served are inventive, fresh, clean, and tasty!  The food, however, seems to be style over substance and I\\'m just not happy at the end of the day!',\n",

Yes, it was good.

While normally that might be a compliment, the sandwich was just overly dry. \\n\\nI much prefer Peppi's Ultra cheesesteak( or the delicious blazing saddle) or even Fernandos cheesesteak, which is a lot more food for less money.\\n\\nI still think this place has potential, but not with the cheesesteak!\",\n",

Half of the french fries were about 3/4 of inch long.\\n\\nNext, the main attraction, the \"winning\" cheesesteak was just not so winning.\\n\\nJust so I\\'m clear\\n\\nThe Bread: it\\'s good, has decent crunch, and is fairly flavorful.\\n\\nThe amount of meat: reasonable for the sandwich, but definitely not generous.  The chicken parm had next to no meat on it!\\n\\nThe flavor: This is the where and why that this place just falls flat on its face.  Once again, the predominate flavor of the whole sandwich is \"Grilled Onions.\"  The steak is flavorless, the mushrooms non-existent, the banana peppers ok.  It just ends up tasting like a whole bunch nothing.\\n\\nI taste grease and onions.  I see no compelling reason to try this again.\\n\\nThe chicken parm and steak tasted almost the same to me.  I almost couldn\\'t tell the difference!  When you start having multiple proteins taste the same, you\\'re doing something wrong!\\n\\nIf you want a decent sandwich, try either Fernando\\'s on Liberty (pretty decent) or Peppi\\'s (even better) on Smithfield towards the bridge.  Fernando\\'s is the closest to PSECS, but Peppi\\'s serves a better sandwich.  Get either the Ultra Cheesesteak or the Blazing Saddle (and see my previous reviews on yelp for both of them!)\\n\\nThumbs down PSECS, thumbs down!',\n",

I'm not 100% sure of the preparation of the mushrooms, but they were way too strong and they certainly didn't gel with the rest of the dish. The roasted pork was small bites of pork belly --- I would have appreciated either more of it, or real pieces of pork. Underwhelming at $13.\\n\\nI get that Pork Belly is all the rage.  I had some recently at the nearby the Butcher and the Rye. But I need something more substantial than that.  More than $0.40 worth of pasta.\\n\\nThe flank steak with rice noodles was better, but again, underwhelming for $16.\\n\\nThe ambiance is nice and very modern.

It was style over substance!\\n\\nThe total price for lunch for two was $50, not including tip.\\n\\nFor similar cuisine, at around half the price, I'd rather take a short walk down to Penn Avenue and go to Nicky's Thai Kitchen.\\n\\nWhile I would have given G&G four-stars for the food and service, I've got to round down due to poor value.\",\n",
       " 960: \"We were attending a concert at Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh and needed to find a place to eat before the show. We ate there on a Monday evening around 5pm. Reserving a table on opentable was quick. We ran a little bit late --- person answering the phone was friendly, and happy to change the time.\\n\\nFirst, the restaurant itself is large, spacious, huge windows, and gorgeous. Exactly what I would expect from a nice steakhouse. They spread the tables out but still manage to serve 300 simultaneously. This is a nice change from a Ruth's Chris, or from Morton's where they pack you in considerably tighter.\\n\\nWe started with drinks, both Ketel One Martini's and mixed cocktails suggested by the waitress. They had a few interesting ones, and they were all very tasty. This might be a great after work place to grab some apps and drinks, albeit an expensive place.\\n\\nWe started with the Alaskan King Crab legs and Barbeque bacon-wrapped Shrimp. The legs were conveniently cut in half and ready to eat -- no fussing around with them like at a Joe's Crab Shack. The barbeque shrimp were large and delicious...great sauce, and everything is better with bacon!@#\\n\\nThe steaks were the main reason we came here. Both steaks were succulent, full flavored, and very nicely seasoned. Like most steakhouses we've been to, our Medium+ orders came out closer to Med Rare, and were simply not cooked perfectly. Both the waitress and manager came around to check on us (a few times, actually) and offered to send them back. We were hungry, somewhat pressed for time, and the cook wasn't so far off to be worthy of much fuss. We would have been happier sending them back, but hindsight is usually 20/20.\\n\\nThe desserts were both delicious -- one was a molten chocolate lava cake type thing, and the other was a HUGE, and I mean HUGE piece of carrot cake. Or was it a whole cake? This thing was probably 5 x 5 x 8 inches. A serious hunk of cake. It was delicious, but after all the food, way too much.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked Eddie Merlot's. Yes, the cook on the steak could have been better, but they offered to rectify that. Most of the food was delicious with careful attention to detail. This was our first time dining here, and it was exactly what I'd hope it would be.\\n\\nThe service was friendly, prompt, courteous, and not at all stiff like we've experienced at other similar places. The recommendations on drinks and appetizers was spot-on. I think we even received a thank you card from the server for dining with them.\\n\\nLet there be no mistake about this: this place is a top-notch \\nThe 30oz (!!!) $99 Wagyu Tomahawk Ribeye is calling my name. I didn't order it because I didn't want to have to be rolled to the concert, but one day I will order that.

       " 961: \"Very close to work for me and the others in my office.  Was excited about getting a steak salad, which I found is a staple here in the Burgh.  The first one I got in July 2012 was good.  I don't know if the method of cooking or person cooking the steak had changed or the meat supplier is different, but after that, I've had two steak salads where the meat was just too tough!  Haven't been back since.  Probably won't go back to get a salad until the meat is cooked tender and not left to become shoe leather.  Not getting a salad again unless someone can convince me that the meat was just cooked and juicy!  \\n\\nPizza's are yummy and pizza lovers will like their small but adequate pizza buffet which has about 8 different types of pizza.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is always crowded  at lunch time.

       " 962: \"I'm not going to lie I don't have much experience with street foods. Pittsburgh simply isn't a big city for them (I've heard San Francisco is the best place for Food Trucks). Other then the occasional hot dog vender they are few and far between here. As far as I remember today was my first street food experience and that took place at Reyna's Taco Shack in the Strip District.\\n\\nI've been told for the past three months by Kandace that they had the best tacos in Pittsburgh here. Being a fan of tacos, and Mexican food in general, I had to judge them for myself. The shack is staffed by a single man armed with two skillets and few ingredients. I ordered a chicken taco and a steak taco to mix it up a bit.\\n\\n\\nThe Chicken Taco:\\n\\nKandace might be right. This was easily one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. Tortillas are something that can easily make or break a taco and these ones were excellent. They were obviously homemade and perfectly cooked. The guy manning the shack briefly grilled them on one skillet then transferred them on top of the filling for awhile. It really added to the overall taste of the taco. The chicken was shredded pretty thin which worried me at first because the chance of it being dry was greatly increased. I couldn't have been more wrong. The chicken was extremely moist and juicy. Perfectly cooked. This guy was a master of his craft. Each taco was topped with a good amount of sour cream, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and cilantro (which was a nice touch). They had three different salsa to choose from but I chose to eat mine plain. I'm glad I did. I could easily eat these tacos 2 or 3 times a week.\\n\\nThe Steak Taco:\\n\\nBasically copy and paste everything I just said above about the chicken tacos. I did have one issue with the steak though. It was cut into tiny cubes which made some (not all) pieces pretty chewy. It wasn't as perfect as the chicken but it was pretty close.\\n\\nThe Rating:\\n\\nWas it filling?: I had 2 tacos and was pretty full. I could have probably had another 2 but I normally devour tacos\\n\\nDid I feel gross afterwards?: Not really\\n\\nWould I go there again?: Yes 100%. I'd like to try a burrito or shrimp taco\\n\\nWould I order it again?: The chicken yes. I think I'd opt to try something different before I got the steak again\",\n",

I don\\'t rave about \"good\" food. I rave about amazing food. The type of food that I have dreams about. The type of food that makes me want to bring about a thousand dollars cash and gorge myself untill I need an ambulance.\\n\\nThe taco stand outside of Reyna Foods makes just that kind of food. Too often when we think of Mexican food, we think of a variety samey tasting, samey textured mixtures of ground beef, yellow cheese, beans, and tomatoes stuffed into a processed flour tortilla covered with a plastic sauce (I\\'m looking at you Emiliano\\'s). Reyna\\'s doesn\\'t just break the mold, they hurl it at the wall, smash the pieces with a bat and then scatter the dust in a blast furnace. The tacos here are aboslutely amazing. Fresh ingredients cooked right there on an old plancha-style grill that has absorbed the flavors of countless meals and stuffed into fresh corn tortillas are a truly enlightening experience. I mean it. \\n\\nThe first time I went here was to just grab a quick snack while walking around in the Strip district. I saw they offered tongue as a protein choice and thought to myself \"What the hell, in for a dime in for a dollar right?\" Best. Choice. Ever. The first bite was like reaching the Seventh Level of Enlightenment. The Buddha said I could ask one question. After careful consideration I asked, \"Can I have another taco?\" After that I made a vow that I would forever be a loyal raving fan.\\n\\nThe tacos are assembled to your liking. I like mine with the works: the perfectly cooked meat on the warm tortilla then covered with queso fresco, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro, fresh lime juice, and sour cream. The flavors all play well together to strike a classical tune of a Mexican bolero on the pallate. As previously mentioned, I like the tongue. It has a wonderful richness and gameyness to it that I have come to love. My far less adventurous girlfriend stays with the chicken. They have other choices ranging from pork, to steak, to shrimp, to the ever popular ground beef (gotta please everyone I guess).\\n\\nAfter you order your tacos, try one of the fresh made flavored waters there. The fresh lime water is always my favorite, and is there every day, but they also have hibiscus, watermelon and other flavor selections. My girlfriend got the horchata, a milk based concoction with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Or you could pop inside the Mexican grocery for a Coke hecho en Mexico. My favorite Coke because they use cane sugar, not HFCS.\\n\\nThe only downside is that they close right around 3:00 PM.\\n\\nCome to Reyna\\'s. The tacos are amazing.

       " 964: 'As early 90\\'s rapper Tone-Loc once said \"Let\\'s do it.\"\\n\\nUnless you have spent your first 20 years or so in a subterranean nuclear fall out bunker, odds are you know of Ruth\\'s Chris. The legendary steakhouse is supposedly the final word in steak outside of NYC and Texas. If this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen. I have been to several Ruth\\'s Chris locations around the PA, NY, and NJ area, but the one here in Market Square is truly a disappointment. \\n\\nWhen I go to a real steakhouse, like Peter Luger\\'s, or the Old Homestead, or any other Ruth\\'s Chris location I have visited, I expect to pay top dollar for top dollar steaks. I will never complain about the price so long as I feel as if the quality and quantity of food as well as the dining experience I recieve is fair in proportion to what I pay. The cheapest steak in the M2 Ruth\\'s Chris will run you about thirty dollars. Normally, this would not be a problem had the establishment lived up to its reputation. Sadly, however, they did not.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s start with the decor. Ruth\\'s Chris is a chain, first and foremost. That being said all locations are going to have the same basic look: old wood, magnum wine bottles, white tableclothes and red walls. I expect this sort of thing in a steakhouse. They are the last holdouts from the old industrial capitalist era. I feel as if I were to walk in, I might see Andrew Carneghie or John Rockefeller sitting at the bar discussing how unffair anti-trust legislation is.\\n\\nContinuing with the bar, Ruth\\'s Chris offers a fantastic wine selection that has a pleasant mixture of affordable, yet quality, choices as well as a few that would cost me six months\\' rent. They also have a decent coctail menu, no doubt created by a corporate mixologist, that I must say is good. My girlfriend is not a fan because she can actually taste the alcohol in the majority of the concoctions, but I think that is a good thing. The bar is about the only place where you get the quality for the money you are spending.\\n\\nThe most dissappointing aspect about my last few visits have been the steaks. Ruth\\'s Chris is known for basting their steaks in butter, which I do like. Fat is deliscious and that is proof enough for me that we are meant to eat it. This is where the goodness ends. On my second to last visit, a member of my party was served a rancid steak. The server tried to say it was dry-aged, but dry-aging does not produce a metallic, green beef. On my most recent visit, I was served a filet mignon that was tough. I have no idea how they were able to serve a tough portion of the least used muscle on the cow, but they did.\\n\\nAll of this brings me back to the service. I understand you are working in a fine dining, expensive steakhouse. I get that you throw down $300 plust dollar checks thirty or so times a night. I get that you are on first name basis with the Pens, Bucs, and Steelers that call themselves your regulars. That does not make me chop liver. I feel that if you are not wearing at least $3,000 worth of clothes or accessories, the staff will basically ignore you.\\n\\nThe saving grace to the place would be the bar and decor I already mentioned, and the sides. Ruth\\'s Chris, like most fine dining establishments runs an a la carte menu. The sides are usually very very good. I like the sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinache, lyonaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and the wedge salad.\\n\\nAll in all, this place gets a two in my book. I think that this is kind of sad given the fact that I was hoping to give them a five, but the quality of the food compared to what you pay just is not up to standard. For $250 I can feed and booze six friends at my house instead of me and my girlfriend at Ruth\\'s Chris.',\n",

I live around the corner and I moved there just so I could walk to the best burgers in the Burgh.\\n\\nTo start with the decor all I can say is it feels like home. Exposed brick. Crammed in tables. Murals on the walls. Antique lighting. Lots of family mementos. I love each and every piece of it. \\n\\nAs far as the service goes I don't think they have hired a large portion of new staff since... ever. And that's ok with me. I love long time servers and bartenders who know everyone and treat you like family. When they get busy it may get a little slow but the service is always so pleasant I don't care. \\n\\nTessaro's does gave a full bar but don't go expecting new age hipster inspired mixology. It's definitely a simple bar from a simple time. Drink your manhattans, vodka martinis, wine and draft beer and be happy. \\n\\nThe big claim to Tessaro's fame is their burger. The burgers are fresh ground juicy and delicious. Also the Tuesday ribs are killer. It all comes down to the wood grill. It makes the whole neighborhood smell heavenly. \\n\\nTo finish up Tessaro's is a perfect example of old school. Everything about them just reeks of tradition.

       " 966: \"I am a fan of Mexican food, good Mexican food. Few things piss me off more than crap Mexican food that winds up being an insult to the nation and the cuisine. The Round Corner Cantina won me over with their ability to not screw up a good thing. I went there on a Thursday night with a couple of friends (who are my culinary cohorts now that my girlfriend is out of town for the summer) and we were pleased with our selection. The four of us first discovered the RCC when we were placed on a wait for Piccolo Forno, an Italian restaurant of unparalled excellence across the street. As Piccolo is sans bar, we sauntered across the street to RCC for some cocktails while we waited. We were so impressed and pleased we decided to make a return trip. This is the story of that trip.\\n\\nWhen one walks into the Round Corner, you are immediately transported to a dingy Baja tequila joint. I love the decor inside, it it classic Mexican bar atmosphere. I almost expect Clint Eastwood to stroll through the front door smoking a stogie and wearing a battered old serape. The building is deceptively large; the front bar is small but through an almost hidden hallway, you are led to a larger dining room and then an outdoor patio area. The Patio area looks and feels like a Baja surf bar. I like it, it's relaxed and cool and right up my alley.\\n\\nIt is easy to tell by the set up of the restaurant and the menu, that Round corner focuses heavily on the bar side of the business. I don't mind this because they do it right. They maintain a large stock of tequilas and mezcals, and here they actually note the difference between the two (no tequila will NEVER have a worm) and their beer selection is populated by mostly Mexican and Carribean lagers. Not the ideal location for a hop head, but on a hot summer night I like those styles, so I was happy with my Red Stripe. Thry also have a coctail menu that is interesting to say the least. Our female friend drank the red sangria and the Something-Star Cocktail and said they were deliscious, but that the sangria was better. For me, I broke up the beer with a Perfect 10, a gin-based play on a mojito. I thought it was quirky and unique, but I switched back to beer (I just don't do fru-fru glassware). One side note, from my prior visit, be careful if you are drinking liquor here. I was ordering single Hendricks' and Tonics and was easily getting doubles and then some.\\n\\nAs far as the service goes, this is where Round Corner loses as star for me. The service at the bar was quick, effiecient and pleasant, but at the table, things slowed waaaay down. They were busy and I do take that into consideration, but it should not take almost two hours for some chips, tacos, and drinks. Our waitress was nice enough and accomodated all our requests, but she was very slow.\\n\\nHowever, when the food did come, we forgot all out complaints. We shared orders of the guacamole, slasa verde, and salsa rojo with chips. The chips are hand made there, as were all of the dips. My favorite was the guacamole, but the salsas, while flavorful, were a little runny for my tastes. The runniness also meant that the guys there got salsa all over us. Followed by the chips we got the tacos. I went full-on-fat-boy and got pork belly, hanger steak, and tempura mahi mahi tacos. Coincidentally, that is also the order of my favorites. Starting with the pork belly, if you are not a fan of fat, steer clear. Actually, scratch that, grow a pair, hit the gym later, and get them any way. The pork belly tacos were excellent; succulent and covered in cilantro, onions, and apples. The steak tacos were good as well, but not quite the experience that the pork belly tacos were. The mahi mahi was the biggest dissappointment. The flavor of the fish was just kind of lost amongst the toppings, namely the cabbage. Also, I feel as if the fis tacos provided the least bang for my buck. They are eight dollars, but are really just a couple tortillas, some sauce, and about three ounces of fish. A bit of a rip if you ask me. I usually don't complain about price, but I did feel it was a little pricey here, especially when I can get tacos of a superior quality from Reyna's in the Strip. I guess you could justify it by saying Reyna's tacos are street food and they don't have to pay for the rent and liquor, but I must counter by saying that the ingredients Round Corner uses are very similar to Reyna's and that Round Corner pays for the liquor with the liquor.\\n\\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Round Corner. The ambiance, quality of food, and bar mean I will be going back at some point, even if I might not be rushing back. I will probably go when I feel like cocktails and decent tacos, but If I am simply on a mission for amazing tacos, Reyna's is still the king in my book. Four Stars\",\n",
       " 967: \"Happy Thanksgiving Yelp Nation! \\n\\nAs a transplant from a small town roughly 200 miles west of the 'Burgh it is a treat when I get to see my family. This year, due to work I had the actual holiday off, but no time for travel. My wonderful family decided to make the 4 hour drive in the snow and holiday traffic to come see their beloved baby boy. As a dedicated bachelor my apartment is suited to making spaghetti and meat balls and maybe a salad. Since this is no suitable Thanksgiving meal, we decided to book a table at McCormick & Schmick's. Truly this was a great decision.\\n\\nTo start with the decor, as usual (creature of habit), one automatically knows what one is in for. The place is full of lots of wood paneling, art-deco light fixtures, white tablecloths, and every other cliched trapping of a post industrialist restaurant. It conjured images of Ruth's Chris, Morton's or Capital Grill. Expensive and pretentious. However I am secretly 73 years old at heart so I kind of like it. At least it is consistent.\\n\\nThe service, which can at times mirror the decor in the high end steakhouse world, was actually quite pleasant. Our waiter, Peter, was very friendly and pleasant without being overbearing. This is a stark contrast to the last time I ate in a restaurant in the same style. Unlike that trip to the Capital Grill, which was me and my family suffering through some of the most condescending service I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing, Peter was warm and inviting and treated us like family. When I open my own restaurant I am cloning him about 20 times and calling it a day.\\n\\nThe main reason anyone goes to M&S, and any restaurant really,  is the food. I had a very memorable Thanksgiving dinner. Everything was amazing. We started with the Shrimp Kisses and the Coast to Coast Tuna. Both were wow dishes for me. The shrimp were lightly fried, stuffed with a pepperjack cheese (which was not overly spicy so big plus there) and wrapped with bacon, because bacon. The Tuna definitely had an Asian flavor profile and was comprised of very good seared tuna and a tuna tartar.\\n\\nI followed the appetizers with an Iceberg Wedge Salad and some oysters. The salad was good, but nothing unique; think the same obligatory wedge salad you find in every steakhouse in America. The oysters were fantastic as well; fresh succulent and just the perfect bite of the ocean.\\n\\nFor dinner I had a grilled swordfish with asparagus, a butternut squash cous cous and a citrus salad on top. I cant even begin to put into words how awesome this dish was, so I'm not going to even try. Just take my lack of word for it.\\n\\nFor dessert, I ended with a chocolate and mocha cheesecake that was a special offering for the day. It was amazing. It was rich and sweet and had just the right balance of crunch in the Oreo crust. The thing I liked the best about it though was the dusting of cinnamon and coco powder put on the plate, obviously as a garnish. However, I had the bright idea to put the garnish on the cake and it gave it a pleasant spicy kick that set the dessert over the top.\\n\\nTo wrap up I like McCormick & Schmick's. Expect to pay top dollar (our bill was pushing $250 and we weren't drinking either) but I feel it was well worth it. The food was amazing, the decor, while a little stuffy, was exactly what I expected, but the star was the service. It is so easy to get caught up in yourself working for a high end restaurant, however our particular server, Peter was absolutely fantastic. I would go back just for him. And the cheesecake. And swordfish. And i need to stop myself before this gets even gushier.\",\n",
       " 968: \"Well I am finally back. I have had a busy few months so I have been absent in my reviews and I am looking forward to getting back into it. NOLA seems to me to be a good place to start.\\n\\nNOLA on Market Square is a great spot to get great Creole, Cajun, and Louisiana inspired cuisine. This type of food is some of my favorite on the planet. Here's an idea: let's take traditional French techniques and dishes, and throw them in a blender with Spanish, African, and American ingredients and methods. That is the basis of Creole cooking and a winning recipe if you ask me. NOLA does it better than anyone I have seen in a long time. I went there with some friends one evening for dinner and drinks. When we got there we were ushered to the back to a table by the kitchen. I was thankful for this for a few reasons. 1) we were out of the front of the restaurant that was being occupied by live music which, while very good Louisiana Jazz, was way too loud for my tastes and 2) we got to see the controlled chaos of a top notch kitchen.\\n\\nNOLA is decorated with the standard Mardis Gras colors of green, yellow, and purple.The bar is long and has all the bottles lining a backlit mirror. I really dig it. It is warm, intimate, and welcoming (so long as the band isn't rocking too hard).\\n\\nService mirrored the the decor. Our server was nice, informative, and followed all the proper steps of perfect service. She seemed to be busy with a full section, yet we were never forced to wait an unreasonable amount of time for our drinks or food. Overall I found the service friendly, competent and all that I could ask for.\\n\\nAs far as the bar is concerned one is in for a treat. NOLA has a decent beer selection with all kinds of Abita products. Hopheads can be content with a Jockomo IPA or a a Purple Haze for the fruit-inclined. Also the cocktail list is rather impressive with all of my selections being delicious, if a little pricey.\\n\\nFor me however, the food is always the main event. For an appetizer I suggest the pork belly (a recurring favorite if you read my reviews). You could also try the alligator bites but they taste just like chicken. Kinda bland. For a main course my go-to is the shrimp and grits. The grits are smooth and creamy with soft fluffy shrimp tossed in all topped with scallions and andouille sausage for heat. Those who possess a spice aversion should try the steak frites. I put it up against Ruth's Chris for quality and taste. \\n\\nAll in all NOLA is a great place. You will pay good money to go but it is definitely worth it in my book.\",\n",
       " 969: 'It seems like everyone in Pittsburgh is ranting and raving about Meat and Potatoes. I have half a mind to join them. However I feel like M&P is like that girl you pick up at 2 AM when the boozer is letting out. Things look great right then and there but looming back the next morning you are left thinking \"Weren\\'t you prettier last night?\" This is my morning after wake up call. \\n\\nWe will start with the decor.  I like it. It\\'s a cool modern take on the kind of look one gets in a classic pub. While this should lend to a warm inviting atmosphere, M&P is somehow able to make is feel cold and pretentious. Secondly, the tables are crammed in so tight big guys like me can end up feeling very cramped. On that note I would like to apologize to the poor people seated next to me on my last visit. The layout forced my butt in your dinner. Sorry. \\n\\nThe service can mirror the feel from time to time. Sometimes I get warm and friendly, other times its cold and unapproachable. Just because you work in a hot downtown location doesn\\'t me you get to be a boor to your guests. \\n\\nThe major saving graces to M&P are the food and the cocktails. The food is killer. My go to favorites are the fried chicken livers (trust me) and the signature Meat and Potatoes for Two (I don\\'t share. Fat guy remember?). Steaks always come out hot and perfectly cooked, but rested enough so they don\\'t bleed out all over your plate. The bar is stellar too. They seem to trend toward updates on classic prohibition era cocktail is but they are done well. The drinks are very well balanced and tasty. Too easy to have too many tipples here. \\n\\nTo wrap up I like M&P. it\\'s pricey but I the k it is worth it. The major issues I have with the place stems from their pretentiousness. They label themselves a \"gastropub\" which to me is entirely redundant. The word supposedly means a bar with great food. Ok you just described a \"pub\". The attitude follows with the decor and the attitude of the workers. It\\'s like meeting this great girl at last call and in the morning you find out she is kinda bitchy. But she\\'s definitely hot enough to call again.',\n",
       " 970: 'Now I am a traveled man. I have eaten cheesesteaks in a lot if towns. Sorry guys but I think we all know that this particular sub is the ONE SINGLE THING Philly can ever claim to beat us at. I had Pat\\'s and Geno\\'s and they are on another level hands down. That being said, Carhops makes a damn good cheesesteak. \\n\\nThe place is a Cadillac themed hole in the wall down in the strip district. I think its kinda cool; I love divey holes. Caddy grills and rims adorn the walls. Rough booths line the walls.  There is a small bar with a few standard domestic drafts and bottles. This is definitely a sub joint that sells beer rather than the other way around. \\n\\nThe steaks themselves are pretty damn good. I often get the GTO (all the subs are named after cars) because the only thing better than a cheesesteak is a cheesesteak with bacon. A big part of what makes their steaks so good isn\\'t just the premium beef they use, but the crusty chewy French bread the subs are served on.  The subs are served in 12\" and 24\" portions with the 24\" running about 20 bucks. For me the subs are a bit pricey but they are some of the best I\\'ve had in the burgh so I don\\'t mind all that much. \\n\\nAll in Carhops is a damn good cheesesteak joint. They provide an excellent change of pace from Primanti\\'s right around the corner. Head down if you ever want a huge well done cheesesteak.',\n",

After that we had the Cajun shrimp. It was decent but nothing special and only had 6 small shrimp. The mango salsa was nice but didn't add much to the dish.

       " 980: \"The service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food, however, was disappointing. The calamari was actually really nice, light and not super greasy, but the Cajun shrimp were tiny and underwhelming. With six very small pieces bathing in oil and a side of flavorless mango salsa, I would not recommend this appetizer at all. I got the shrimp scampi entree, which comes with the vegetable of the day, salad and potatoes. The potatoes and salad were good, but the corn was very small and brown. It looked like it went bad and they cooked it anyway. Then I tasted it and knew it went bad and they cooked it anyway. That, for me, ruined my whole meal. No amount of butter and salt could save that corn. My bf got the steak with battered shrimp. He enjoyed his meal but didn't want the potatoes and corn. They wouldn't substitute with anything except salad so basically it was $30 for a piece of steak and a few pieces of shrimp. For seafood, in general, the prices were not bad, but I rather pay more and have a better quality meal.\",\n",

       " 986: 'For my boyfriend\\'s birthday earlier this week, he told me that he wanted steak for dinner.  Steak he wants, steak he gets!  We did a little bit of research about where to get a great piece of meat in Pittsburgh, and we finally decided to check out Morton\\'s.  We\\'d heard of it from Chicago, and it definitely has a good reputation there too.\\n\\nSo we came in for our 7:30 reservation on a Tuesday.  The hostess greeted us warmly, and led us into the dimly lit room to our booth.  I had told them on OpenTable that it was my boyfriend\\'s birthday, and my mom called ahead to pre-order some things, so the waitstaff knew that we were celebrating.  And wow, somebody told him \"Happy birthday!\" every 15 minutes!  They all knew about it!  Our menus actually had \"Happy 28th birthday, Taylor!\" printed on them.  My mom had pre-ordered sparkling wine, which was waiting for us on ice when we arrived.  The sommelier (wearing a tux!) poured it for us.  After we toasted, a hostess came by with a digital camera and snapped our picture.  Five minutes later, she came back with a print out of the picture, and a birthday card signed by various servers.  Wowza!\\n\\nWe felt unbelievably welcomed.  We helped ourselves to a slice of the huge loaf of onion-y bread sitting on the table, while we listened to our server tell us about the various menu offerings.  It\\'s a little funny how they have examples of the food sitting under plastic wrap.  It does give you a nice visual for the steaks, but it\\'s a little funny for....asparagus.  Still, seeing the size of the meat helped us make our choice.\\n\\nFirst, we got the onion soup and the Caesar salad.  The onion soup was served bubbling hot, with a layer of cheese baked on top, of course.  It was very tasty - not the best I\\'ve ever had, but it definitely hit the spot for two hungry people!  Something about the broth was a bit too sweet perhaps.  The Caesar was great - they knew we were splitting it so they served it on two perfectly portioned plates - you could taste every single ingredient that goes in a classic Caesar.  You know they made this dressing perfectly - can\\'t leave out the anchovy!  Delicious.\\n\\nWe each got the bone-in Ribeye, which was 20 oz of medium-rare amazingness.  Our steaks were unbelievably tender and flavorful.  The meat was pretty marbled, but the fat was so succulent that honestly I ate every bite of it.  The meat needs no sauce - just that luscious char on top and warm tender beef within.  Fantastic.  Loved every bite.  Our one wish was that the plates were warmed - since they were cool, it seemed like the steak was cooling down faster than it should.  But that didn\\'t stop us from loving our wonderful dinner!\\n\\nMom had pre-ordered two desserts, their classic chocolate cake and the creme brulee.  I didn\\'t taste the cake, but my boyfriend said it was incredibly rich and decadent.  I loved the creme brulee, and somehow finished every bite despite being stuffed already.\\n\\nService was always friendly, the ambiance was romantic, and truly I felt like we were royalty.  Come here on a special occasion, and you\\'ll see what I mean.  It is a very expensive place to eat, but totally worth it for a special occasion.  With prices that high, you deserve to feel like their most cherished patrons of all time, and we certainly did.  I would very much like to come back the next time we have something to celebrate and want to have a big steak at the same time!',\n",
       " 987: \"I'd been sick for a few days and not up for cooking, so my boyfriend and I went in search of a cheap lunch.  Uncle Sam's, down the block, had been calling our name for weeks.  In need of big-time sustenance to help me fight the germs, I was ready for a meaty sandwich.\\n\\nInside, there was plenty of seating, and a few TVs showing the Penguins game.  The staff behind the counter was young and enthusiastic, chatting with each other and commenting on the hockey action.  We placed our orders at the far end of the counter - I got the Loaded Italian Sausage sub (comes with flavorful Italian sausage, grilled onions/peppers, and cheese).  I was confused when the girl taking my order asked if I wanted lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Um....no.  That seems totally wrong on an Italian sausage and peppers sandwich.  My boyfriend got a Philly cheesesteak, and despite my badgering, he DID get it with tomatoes, lettuce, and mayo.  His philosophy is pretty much to get every available topping on a sandwich if it will make it more delicious.\\n\\nWe waited for about 10 minutes while a guy working a big grill surface browned up our meat.  It was fun to watch Taylor's cheesesteak turn from a gorgeous deep red to a delicious steaky brown.  I appreciate that they cook everything to order here, and they don't have piles of cooked meat waiting around to be thawed or microwaved or anything.  Our sandwiches were about $7 each I think, which was reasonable since the ingredients seemed pretty fresh, and the sandwiches were huge.\\n\\nWe took them home, and they were still warm when we unwrapped them.  They were both pretty good - I didn't exactly hear angels singing, but the meat was flavorful in each (and both sandwiches were definitely heavy on the meat!)  A regular size person with a normal appetite could easily get two meals out of one big sandwich.  I preferred my Italian sausage to the cheesesteak, since mine had more seasonings, the addition of grilled veggies, and no (totally boring and unnecessary lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  no!)  \\n\\nI was thinking 3 1/2 stars, trying to determine whether to give them an edge up or down, when my boyfriend told me that the people behind the counter making the sandwiches weren't wearing gloves?  .....blargh.  I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but he assured me that he saw the grill-guy pick up our meat with bare hands and put it on the grill.  To be fair, there were some little pieces of wax paper partially enclosing the meat, but still.  And the girl who wrapped our sandwiches did not have gloves on either, he noticed.  Maybe they work really hard to avoid directly touching the food....but still, I'd say gloves are preferable.\\n\\nI'm pretty much the opposite of a germophobe, so I don't really care that much, but I think 3 stars is fair for now.  I'm sure we'll be back to try another sandwich, and if it impresses me, I think 4 stars is in their future.  WAAAAAAAY better than a Jimmy John's/Subway type place, no contest there.\",\n",
       " 988: 'My boyfriend and I came here with a reservation on a Friday night around 6:30.  We were seated right away in the dark downstairs dining room, where the walls are lined with wood, and the wood is lined with wine bottles.  Our seating was comfortable, and not too close to the table next to us (relief).  The restaurant didn\\'t seem incredibly busy - comfortably populated, but a few empty tables scattered around.  You might not even need a reservation.\\n\\nOur server was very casual, in his dress and demeanor (jeans and black button downs seem to be the uniform).  His interactions with us were a little lax, a little moreso than I expected, given that it\\'s a somewhat pricey joint, but he was knowledgeable and happy to give recommendations, which is always appreciated.\\n\\nThe menu changes daily, so there are no specials.  Everything is a special, in that sense.  The wine list, printed on the back, was absolutely delightful since almost every bottle can be ordered in a taster portion, a half glass, a full glass, or a bottle.  Lovely!  I ordered three tasters throughout the evening, and it was such a fun experience.  We drank white with our appetizers, red for dinner, and sparkling for dessert.  I was never too drunk or too full of wine, the price was great, the taster portions were more generous than I expected, and I got to try five kinds of wine.  Hard to beat.\\n\\nWe had a Montravel from Spain, which my boyfriend loved, and their Riesling, which I loved.  Both wines were flavorful and unique, and it was a truly great experience to have excellent wine again, compared to our usual bottles purchased cheaply from the store.  Our appetizers were the Mac and Cheese (goat cheese, local sausage, and a fried egg in the dish), and the Stuffed Poblano Peppers.  The Mac \\'n\\' Cheese was good, creamy but not too heavy, and the pasta was orzo which was fun.  But the Peppers  - just to die for.  To.  Die.  They had been roasted, it seems, or grilled, and were filled with the most flavorful housemade pork sausage.  We were both bowled over.  If this is on the menu, don\\'t miss it.  Their sausage is the real deal.\\n\\nNext we got two tasters of red, the Cotes-du-Rhone and something else....also very uniquely flavored and rich wines.  Our entrees were the Suckling Pig and the Hanger Steak.  The steak was my favorite - cooked to a delightful medium rare and served with roasted potatoes and rutabegas, it was simple and unpretentious.  Great beef flavor, nothing too intrusive or unusual.  Just high quality food.  The pig was good as well - the texture was divine, soft and reminiscent of pulled pork only better.  The sweet potato mash alongside was great.  My only complaint was the sauce was, in my opinion, too salty.  Anything it touched became too salty, and the sweet potato mash was needed to cut through that sodium taste.  I think it bothered me more than it bothered my boyfriend.  We absolutely finished both plates, practically licking them clean, but I\\'d watch out for that sauce if you\\'re sensitive to salt.\\n\\nFor dessert I had a glass of moscato, sweet and lovely, and we split the \"peanut butter ice cream sandwich\" which seemed more like a peanut butter pie, but who\\'s complaining?  It was very good and a great end to the meal.\\n\\nAll this for about $75.  The way they price their wines makes all the difference, and a great meal instantly becomes much more affordable than you\\'d expect.  I\\'d recommend Toast! to anyone, especially wine lovers.  It was such a treat, and didn\\'t break the bank.',\n",

You order up front and then the food is brought out to you.\\n\\nI got some loose mint tea, served in an abundantly big pot, and my husband got a decaf latte.  We could barely decide what to get, but decided on the steak tacos served with a variety of salads alongside for my husband, and the flatbread plate for me - grilled chicken, chickpea and tomato stew, hummus, baba ganoush, olives, and bread.\\n\\nThe food was as fresh and lovely as I could have hoped.  Steak tacos were great, cooked beautifully medium-rare and filled with a luscious avocado spread.  Loved the fun salads alongside.  Tacos don't seem like a healthy meal, but here it really did!  Loaded with veggies.  My plate was also great, with juicy chicken, simmering hot chickpea stew, creamy hummus, great marinated olives, and more.  I wasn't mad keen on the baba ganoush, but really enjoyed dipping the flatbread in the hummus and taking big bites, mixing all the different components together.  \\n\\nPrices were very reasonable, our portions filled us up, and the food quality was very high.

I'd suggest going with a group of people so then you can order the porterhouse for 2. It is delicious. They bring it out on a hot place and set it between the 2 people eating it. You are then each given a piping hot plate with hot butter drizzled on it. The server then puts some of the meat on your plate and rubs it around in the butter. Delicious. For the sides, I would suggest getting the creamed spinach. The asparagus isn't bad either. \\n\\nI actually went there for my fraternity senior class dinner with a group of 8 guys and they gave us our own room which was really cool. You just have to put down a cover for each person which you lose if one guy doesn't show up.

Another got the pork chops while the other 2 got the New York strip.\\n\\nFor appetizers, I got the French Onion Soup. Oh. This restaurant has a special way to cook the meat if you want to try something new. It\\'s called Pittsburgh Rare where the meat is \"flash seared and charred on the outside and blood red on the inside.\" It\\'s actually not very hot in the middle. Since the restaurant is named Pittsburgh Rare, I figured, why not, give it a shot. \\n\\nIt was suprisingly not bad at all. The french onion soup was delicious. The way a french onion soup should  be tasted and the creamed spinach was very good. The total tab was about $100 / person because we also got desert and 2 bottles of wine.',\n",
       " 993: \"De Luca's was featured on Man V Food - Pittsburgh. I had been going to this place since my junior year at CMU and I find it to be the best breakfast place I have ever eaten at. Whenever I go back to Pittsburgh to visit friends or for Steelers games, I always try and hit up Pramanti Brothers, William Penn for the the Kitchen Sink Wings and De Luca's for their breakfast.\\n\\nWell. There is always a line to this place. I've seen it go around the block sometimes but there are also times when you can be the first in line. It all depends on what the crowd is like. This place specializes in breakfast but you can also get lunch food as well. You have to pay cash and you will most likely not find street parking anywhere near there so look for a lot or try the streets around it. The place is ALWAYS crowded so if you see some seats open at the bar, grab them cuz those are first come first serve.\\n\\nOnto breakfast, I've tried a lot of their options but I love their Steak Mixed Grill. This gets me a sliced medium rare steak, 2 eggs over easy, veggies, sweet roast peppers, tomatoes and home fries. This meal was one of the dishes that Adam Richmond ate when he went there for Man V Food. I'll usually get this with a strawberry milkshake (which is enormeous) and that will completely fill me up.\\n\\nI've also had the eggs benedict which is really good, the famous breakfast burrito (best breakfast burrito I've ever eaten), the buttermilk pancakes (better than Pamela's short cakes) and a Greek Omelette.\\n\\nHowever, I now that I only go back to Pittsburgh once or twice a year, I usually just get the steak mixed grill. De Luca's is so much better than Pamela's and Pamela's is a really good breakfast place too. I definitely love coming here.\",\n",
       " 994: \"How can you not like Primanti Brothers. I need to hit up this place whenever I'm in town. The combination of the cole slaw, fries, tomato, italian bread, cap and cheese are to die for. I've tried to make this sandwich when I lived in St. Louis after I graduated and I can never get it the same because the italian bread is near impossible to find there and the cole slaw is just so much better home made. Let's just get this straight, this sandwich is enormous. The cap and cheese is their number 1 best seller. They have the philly cheesesteak written down as their number 2 best but don't have anything mentioning the number 1. Well. It's the cap and cheese. Oh man. Have one of these with a nice bottle of Yuengling and you can't go wrong.\",\n",
       " 995: \"Morton's... Well where to start. I took my girlfriend here to celebrate some important events that occured all within a week. It took close to a week to decide where we had wanted to try and we decided first to make it upscale, and secondly about steak. Well we had our clear choice to be Morton's. \\n\\nWe enjoyed the ambience and atmosphere that was provided as well as the wonderful and informed wait staff. We had reservations and were actually sat early which was fantastic! I am a big lover of steaks so I chose the porterhouse, while my girlfriend had the double cut filet. \\n\\nWe started first with a salad wedge which I found to be tasty, very crisp and fresh. My girlfriend had the lobster bisque which she loved. Our steaks came out after we finished our staters and our wonderful bread loaf. \\n\\nI must say the steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it and I ate every bit of that monster! We finished off with the hot chocolate cake which was devoured rather quickly. All in all it was a wonderful experience and for me very much worth the money.\",\n",
       " 996: 'I took my girlfriend here for our 6 month anniversary dinner for a nice night out. I had been here several times before but she had not. As per past experience it was a very nice experience with a good wait staff, and wonderful food. As usual I managed to devour every bit of my t-bone. When asked ifnwe were going to have dessert we declined as we decided to go to our favorite dessert place. We were pleasantly surprised when our waitress retrned with a plate which had strawberries and whipped cream, and happy anniversary written in chocolate! Needless to say that was quite wonderfully sweet in a few ways! All in all we will be dining here again.',\n",
       " 997: 'THIS IS THE BEST STEAKS ANYWHERE!!! Great staff as well. It is a go to place for us when we are in the mood for steaks!!',\n",
       " 998: \"I know I'm a steak snob but I found this Mortons perfectly adequate. The service was just okay. We asked our waiter for a recommendation on a side dish and he not only forgot to bring it but also what we ordered!  And you think they were bottling it themselves when we asked for a second bottle of wine. The only saving grace was the chocolate mousse which was a little cup of whipped heaven.\",\n",
       " 999: 'It\\'s Morton\\'s... High end steakhouse with high end decor, service, and food quality. Nothing particularly amazing or different from this locations, but I did find the 3 course special to be a great value. Morton\\'s was just purchased by Landry\"s which may lead to even more corporate feel. I could tell (because our waiter told us) that most of the staff is not exactly thrilled about the acquisition. We will see...',\n",
